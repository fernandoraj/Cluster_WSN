   83:  Calculations using the Sheffield University plasmasphere ionosphere model have shown that under certain conditions an additional layer can form in the low latitude topside ionosphere. This layer (the F3 layer) has subsequently been observed in ionograms recorded at Fortaleza in Brazil. It has not been observed in ionograms recorded at the neighbouring station, Sao Luis. Model calculations have shown that the F3 layer is most likely to form in summer at Fortaleza due to a combination of the neutral wind and the E x B drift acting to raise the plasma. At Fortaleza the horizontal wind moves the plasma up the inclined field lines; at Sao Luis the field lines are nearly horizontal and the wind cannot raise the plasma further

   83:   Priestley and Taylor provided a practical formulation of the partitioning of net radiation between heat flux and evaporation contained within a parameter alfa . Their model (PTM) needs verification under a range of environmetal condition. Micrometeorological data sets collected over the Amazon forest at the Ducke Reserve site (2 degrees 57'S; 59 degrees 57'W) gave an opportunity to evaluate alfa. Evidence presented here and by others shows that there is pronounced diurnal variation in alfa, with minimum values around midday and maximum values in the morning and evening hours. During unstable and stable conditions in the daylight hours, the Bowen ratio (B) varied from 0.10 to 0.57 and -0.71 to -0.08, respectively, whereas alfa varied from 0.67 to 1.16 and 1.28 to 3.12, respectively. A mean value of alfa =1.16 more or less 0.56 was obtained from daytime hourly values for two days. The daily data sets from three expeditions gave a mean of alfa=1.03 more or less 0.13. This work confirms that alfa is a function of atmospheric stability over the Amazon forest. Thus the PTM should be applied with caution over time-intervals of one day or less because of the sensitivity to variation in alfa. The calculated values of alfa are in general agreement with those reported in literature

   83:   The frequency of surface cyclogenesis over South America (approximately the area enclosed by 15 degrees - 50 degrees S and 30 degrees - 90 degrees W) has been calculated using 10 years (1979-1988) of data. The frequency of cyclogenesis is more in winter than in any other season. Highest frequency (139) is found in the month of May and the lowest frequency(71) is found in the month of December. In addition to seasonal variation, the frequency of cyclogenesis shows interannual variation. The occurrence of cyclogenesis is more during the years of negative Southern Oscillation index (EL Nino years) and less during the years of positive Southern Oscilation index. The years of higher (lower) cyclogenesis are found to be associated with higher (lower) rainfall. This explains the negative correlation between the precipitation over southern Brazil and the Southern  Oscillation index

   83:    The influence of the Andes Cordillera on transient disturbances is investigated in this study using a lagcorrelation analysis. This analysis shows that the unfiltered geopotential height data have a wavelike pattern moving to the east while tilting to the west in the vertical. When the wave approaches the Andes Cordillera, it exhibits orographic effects such as anticyclonic turning of a low-level disturbance trajectory, a zonal trajectory in the upper levels, distortions of the isolines of correlation, and an elongation of maximum correlation on the lee side of the Andes. The anticyclonic turning of the trajectory in the low-altitude level and a zonal trajectory in upper levels implies a decrease in the vertical tilt of the system on the windward side and an increase in the tilt on the lee side. The increase of baroclinicity on the lee side results in baroclinic development as predicted from a linearly obtained normal-mode solution in the presence of mountains. A cross-correlation analysis of the high-pass-filtered disturbances shows an eastward phase propagation and a westward vertical tilt with height on the order of one-quarter wavelength between 1000-and 300-hPa levels. The horizontal structure and phase propagation show characteristics similar to the fastest-growing baroclinic normal mode in a two-layer, quasigeostrophic, Beta-plane, linear model with a mountain placed in the north-south direction. This shows that the high-pass-filtered anomalies over the South American region are associated with baroclinic disturbances influenced by the Andes Cordillera. The results further show that the interaction of these anomalies with the Andes Cordillera is responsible for lee cyclogenesis. The composite maps show that the positive and negative high-pass-filtered anomalies have the same structure and paths of phase propagation. These anomalies intensity over the Pacific Ocean near the South American continent

   83:  A power spectral analysis of geomagnetic data between June and November 1982 from Vassouras, a low-latitude observatory located in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA), is carried out in order to investigate the origin of multiple peaks commonly observed in the energetic electron spectra in the inner magnetosphere. Comparison with energetic electron observations made by the low-altitude satellite S81-1 during the same time interval [Datlowe et al., 1985] indicates that even it the peaks are due to a quasi-resonance process as Cladis [1966] has suggested, whereby energetic electrons are accelerated and transported radially as a result of magnetic fluctuations with periods comparable to their azimuthal drift periods, the driver of such magnetic fluctuations is not the ionospheric current in the equatorial electrojet, modulated by electron precipitation in the SAMA region, such as Cladis [1966] proposed. We suggest that the source of drift-resonant magnetic fluctuations, if they exist, must instead be sought in the solar wind. Otherwise, the drift-resonant mechanism cannot be viable

   83:    If rainfall, storage and flux divergence are known, evapotranspiration can be estimated as the residual in a budget of atmospheric misture. We describe a new approach to misture-budget estimates of Amazon evapotranspiration. Synoptic observations ( and numerical model analyses from the U.S. National Meteorological Center) are combined with wind, humidity and rain information retrieved from radiances measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satelite (GOES). Rainfall is inferred from the thermal infrared of the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR). Humidity is retrieved from the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS). Winds are inferred from both VISSR and VAS images, using visible, thermal infrared and water vapor bands. Satellite and station or model informations is merged by means of a recusive filter. The GOES-budget approach was tested over a three-day period from May 1987. Our estimate of evapotranspiration over the basing, 9mm/d, is unrealistically large. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the largest part of the error originated in GOES cloud and water vapor winds and the next largest part in VAS humidity. We conclude that the approach failed in its first test. However, since the test was conducted researchers have found better algorithms for selecting cloud and water vapor targets and for assigning altitudes. In addition, simulation suggest that even in the absene of better algorithms the next generation of GOES will provide more accurate winds and humidity than the present generation. If it is supported by direct measurements of evapotranspiration, a second test of the approach might be successful

   83:  China-Brazil Earth Remote Sensing Satellite (CBERS) is taking shape presently, fruiftying the concept of multi-resolution imaging, spreading from visible to far infrared, backed-up by multination efforts which is more appealing than ever, replacing today's duplicate efforts in the world scanario, "shaping eyes in the shy" with a spirit of cooperation in the place of competition. These sensors are grouped in three parts, the first two being self-scanned type, and the other one is characterized by opto-mechanical scanning, and are named as HRC, WFI and MSS, the spatial resolutions of which varies over a long range of 20 to 260 meters. The WFI is a CCD Camera with wide field imaging capacity, characterized to generate low resolution ground images with a high repetitive cycle, less than five days, introducing a marco to micro imaging capacity for the CCD Payloads giving an indication of built-in zoom type facility, in conjunction with off-nadir pointing CCD High Resolution Camara (HRC). The details of the above optical sensors will be presented in this paper

   83:    Apresentam-se as primeiras medidas Sistematicas do metano atomosferico (CH4) na baixa troposfera em diferentes localidades do Brasil, e o seu fluxo em uma lagoa do Pantanal Mato-Grossense. Para sua determinacao quantitativa otimizou-se um cromatografo com detector de ionizacao de chama. Comparam-se os dados da concentracao de CH4 da superficie obtidos em Natal, RN ( 6 graus S) e Cuiaba, MT ( 16 graus S) com valores obtidos por outros autores em estacoes maritimas, em latitudes proximas. As medias anuais para Natal ( 1993:1675 mais ou menos 28 ppbv, 1994:1682 mais ou menos 29 ppbv) coicidem as observadas nas estacoes maritimas, bem como o padrao de variacao sazonal, o qual mostra amplitudes apena da ordem de 1
   83:   em relacao aos vaores medios; embora os dados apresentem consideravel dispersao. A maioria das estacoes de monitoramento da rede NOAA e maritima. Para a estacao de Cuiaba observaram-se medias com valores bem superiores aos esperados para a sua latitude. Este resutado parece estar diretamente relacionado a presenca de fontes locais, tais como a queima de biomassa na estacao seca. Perfis de metano realizados na baixa troposfera, nas epocas chuvosas e seca na regiao do Cerrado, utilizando uma aeronave Bandeirante montraram um aumento na concentracao do perfil medio em Cuiaba ( 1665 mais ou menos 24ppbv na epoca chuvosa e 1717 mais ou menos 15 mppbv na epoca seca ), quando o numero de queimadas e maior, evindenciando a participacao destas na emissao de metano para a atmosfera. Finalmente, obtiveran-se medidas de fluxo de CH4 em uma lagoa de Pantanal, em duas estacoes diferentes. Os fluxos medios foram 76 mais ou menos 110 mg CH4 m-2 dia -1 (abril) e 32 mais ou menos 52 mg CH4 m-2 dia -1 ( agosto-setembro), que sao comparaveis aos fluxos encontrados em areas alagadas na Amazonia

   83:    As part of the Global Tropospheric Experiment/Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment 2A, micrometeorological measurements were made using a 45 m scaffolding tower located in the Ducke Reserve Forest site (2 degrees 57 min S, 59 degrees 57 min W) 26 Km northeast of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. We report the daily variation within and above the forest of several meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, winds, radiation exchange, and energy partition into latent and sensible heat fluxes. Estimates of eddy diffusivity coefficients for momentum, heat, and water vapor were made using the observed profiles. These results provide information on the physical processes involved in the exchange of momentum, heat, and water vapor between the forest and the air layer above. To account for the anomalies in eddy diffusivities, a brief discussion is presented based on turbulent transport processes

   83:  In this work we propose a new paradigm of Artificial Neural Net (RIVA): the Unsupervised Morphologic Net (RMNS portuguese-speaking), characterized by competitive learning. this paradigm belongs to a class of translation invariant nets and it is based on gray level Mathematical Morphology (MM), Carpenter and Grossberg's ART, and Kohonen net models. In the activation phase, the template matching operator is implemented using translation invariant MM elementary operators. these operators enable a robust pattern detection with respect to addictive or subtractive noise, and lor small deformations of the patterns to be recognized. In the training phase, the RMNS uses a Kohonen learning rule variation and a reset system inspired by Carpenter and Grossberger's ART model

Determinou-se o coeficiente de dispersao lateral do contaminante (Ky), utilizando a estimativa do desvio padrao lateral da distribuicao de material na pluma (sy), suposta gaussiana, obtida das imagens LANDSAT. O coeficiente de dispersao vertical do contaminante (Kz) foi determinado atraves do modelo de Weinstock (1978b, 1981), que utiliza a taxa de dissipacao de energia cinetica turbulenta (E), obtida tanto a partir de imagens LANDSAT como de dados de radiossondagem, e a frequencia de Brunt-Vaissala (N), que e calculada de dados de radiossondagem. Tambem, obtiveram-se o numero de Richardson fluxo (Rf), a escala de Ozmidov (Lo) e o numero de Richardson gradiente (Ri), este ultimo indicativo da estabilidade atmosferica. Todos estes parametros da camada limite atmosferica apresentam uma dependencia com estabilidade igual a constatada tanto em observacoes no oceano (estratificacao estavel), quanto em laboratorio (turbulencia em decaimento em escoamento estratificado), onde para Ri = RIc tem-se uma maxima mistura do contaminante; para Ri < RIc existe uma turbulencia ativa, enquanto para Ri > RIc, a flutuabilidade inibe progressivamente a turbulencia. Os valores de Ky e Kz variam respectivamente, de 10 1 a 10 2 e de 10-3 a 10 1m2s-1, para uma estratificacao estavel, enquanto para E e N obteve-se uma relacao da forma E=aNY, com y entre 0,5 e 1. Estes resultados concordam com os obtidos por outros autores sobre superficies de agua

   83:   As tempestades geomagneticas estao associadas a corrente de anel, que e governada pela injecao de energia produzida essencialmente durante o acoplamente vento solar-magnetosfera devido a reconexao magnetica na magnetopausa. Este trabalho identificou as origens interplanetarias das tempestades geomagneticas moderadas (-100 nT < Dst-min <-50 nt) e analisou os processos de acoplamento durante a fase principal das tempestades. Para isto foram utilizadas as medidas do campo magnetico interplanetario (CMI) e da temperatura, densidade e velocidade do vento solar, obtidas pelo satelite ISEE-3, juntamente com os indices de atividade geomagnetica equatorial Dst e auroral AE, fornecidos pelo "Word Data Center", do periodo de agosto de 1978 a dezembro de 1979. Identificaram-se 78 tempestades moderadas, das quais 40 eventos de tempestades (Dst iniciando O Nt) puderam ser selecionados. Relacionados com esses eventos bem definidos, as seguintes origens interplanetarias foram encontradas: fenomenos de ejecao de massa coronal - EMC (40

   83:   dos fenomenos EMC ocorrem proximos a lamina de corrente heliosferica. No estudo do desenvolvimento, verificou-se que todas as funcoes de acoplamento energetico na magnetopausa apresentaram um comportamento similar, isto e, a componente sul do CMI, no sistema referencial da magnetosfera, e quem essencialmente regula o acoplamento. A funcao do tipo campo eletrico Ey e a funcao do tipo potencia eletrica resultaram no melhor ajuste linear no acoplamento. No entanto, as complexidades nessas relacoes de acoplamento indicam a acao conjunta de outros processos de transferencia energetica, tais como transferencias nao proporcionais, interaáoes viscosas e processo de descarga abrupta da energia armazenada na cauda magnetosferica

   83:   Em continuidade aos recentes estudos de mudancas climaticas causadas pelo desmatamento na Amazonia, como a diminuicao da evaporacao local (Wright et al., 1992), e a reducao de 20
   83:   na precipitacao regional (Nobre et al.,1991), utiliza-se o modelo da biosfera SiB (Sellers et al.,1986) para a calibracao de seus parametros em regioes de pastagem na Amazonia e a analise da influencia da vegetacao de superficie na estrutura da camada limite e na formacao da atividade convectiva na coluna atmosferica. A interacao da vegetacao com a atmosfera e aqui estudada utilizando-se um modelo unidimensional de 18 camadas na vertical com parametrizacoes de superficie, difusao vertical turbulenta, radiacao de ondas curtas e longas, canveccao rasa e profunda e precipitacao de grande escala. E analisado o desempenho de um esquema de controle (Ctr1D), cuja superficie e baseada nas leis de similaridade de Monin e Obukhov (1954) e evaporacao segundo a equacao de Penman-Monteith, alem de um esquema de fechamento turbulento de 1 ordem na camada limite, em comparacao com um novo modelo acoplado neste trabalho (SiB1D), que tem o modelo SiB) na superficie e um esquema de fechamento turbulento de ordem 2.0 (Mellor e Yamada, 1982) na camada limite. O modelo SiB1D mostra-se realista em simular os fluxos de calor sensivel e latente a superficie para areas de floresta e pastagem na Amazonia. Alem disso, obten-se uma resolucao numerica que suprime oscilacoes originalmente encontradas no modelo Ctr1D. As simulacoes do SiB1D mostram que a atividade convectiva e mais intensa na coluna atmosferica sobre a floresta do que sobre a pastagem, com aumento de 25 a 50
   83:   na precipitacao. Isto levaria a um aquecimento de ate 2,5 K na media troposfera e ao umedecimento ate na ordem de 2,0g/Kg na camada limite maiores sobre a floresta

   83:   Utilizamos uma amostra atualizada de 134 aglomerados globulares com um erro em magnitude de 0,40 para testar um novo modelo de estimacao da distancia ao Centro Galactico. O modelo se baseia num diagnostico dos efeitos de selecao na distribuicao azimutal local dos aglomerados para redistribui-los sistematicamente em torno de candidatos ao suposto centro de simetria do sistema. O procedimento testa subamostras de extensao espacial variada e utiliza a media, a mediana e uma media ponderada por coeficientes bionomiais para estimar separadamente o deslocamento do centroide dos sistemas alterados. Para cada subamostra selecionamos o candidato com a menor modulacao de seu deslocamento medio conjunto com a dispersao associada, e concluimos a partir de uma analise de medias ponderadas que o resultado mais consistente favorece uma estimativa de Ro=6,90+0,33Kpc

Examples of parameter-izations for interactions of this type at low, middle, and high latitudes, intended for use in numerical predictions, are presented. A new parameterization for hmF2 in terms of wind-and electric field-driven drifts at equatorial latitudes is given, and verifications of the accuracy of previously developed parameterizations at middle and high latitudes are provided

   83:  The problem of downward mapping of equatorial ionospheric electric fields is studied in two dimensions employing the finite elements and finite differences numerical techniques. The solutions obtained for low latitudes are compared with known results for high latitudes. It is found that equatorial ionospheric electric fields of scale lengths of the order of 100 km or more reach balloon heights (30-40 km) without undergoing noticeable attenuation. However, in the case of equatorial ionospheric electric fields of scale lengths of a few tens of kilometers it is found that these fields reach balloon heights with severe attenuation. The corresponding attenuation factors are significantly larger than those known for high latitudes. It is also shown that the presence of mountains with a fairly large height as well as of a large-scale conductivity irregularity in the middle atmosphere, such as that expected in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA) region during energetic electron precipitation events, can considerably distort the mapped ionospheric electric fields at the middle atmosphere

It is concluded that empirical models are the most reliable reference for the dynamical equilibrium behaviour of the thermosphere. The three-dimensional time dependent models still need some work before they reach their final stage

Wave structures in the electron density profile having a scale length of -1.5 km to -10 km and amplitude of-10 percent of the ambient density were detected during the downleg trajectory. Possible sources of these waves are discussed, and their possible implication for irregularity formation under nighttime conditions is briefly mentioned

   83:   Annual and interannual variations of rainfall over Brazil are discussed. First, rainy and dry seasons for several stations of Brazil are determined using the data of 21 years(1958-1978). The progressive movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone seems to be associated with the progresive variation of rainfall seasons in the equatorial eastern Brazil. The annual migration of deep tropical convection from Central and southern Portion of the Amazon basic in austral  summer to the northwestern sector of South America in austral winter seems to be responsible for the annual cycle of  rainfall in the Amazon basin. The conncection between the interannual variation of rainfall over Brazil and the Southern Oscillation is also discussed. The correlation coefficient between the Southern Oscillation index and the rainfall is generally small over most of Brazil except over Rio Grande do Sul. The correlation between the spring rainfall of Rio Grande do Sul and and the Southern Oscillation index of the same or of the previous season is significantly high and shows prospects for seasonal rainfall prediction

   83:  Equatorial ionospheric plasma bubble zonal velocities were measured using two 630-nm scanning photometers. Simultaneous scanning measurements were made in two east-west planes that were tilted 30 degrees northward and southward of the vertical. The results of measurements carried out during 5 days covering the summer equinoctial period of 1988, presented here, show evidence of marked latitudinal gradient in the bubble zonal velocities, the velocities decreasing with increasing latitude over low-latitude observing site, Cachoeira Paulista (-28 degrees dip). We suggest that this velocity gradient is consistent with expectations at solar minimum, when our measuremnts may be associated with the region above the maximum in the eastward plasma velocity height profile

   83:  A comparative study is carried out between a semi-empirical low-latitude ionospheric model (SLIM), including calculated 01630 nm airglow emission intensities predicted by the SLIM model, with ionospheric and 01 630 nm airglow measurements carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (22.71S, 45.01W; geomag. 11.9'S), Brazil. A long series of regular measurements of ionospheric F-region peak electron densities and peak heights, and regular zenith measurements of the 01630 nm airglow emission intensities, made during the period 1975-1982, are used for comparison with corresponding parameters predicted by the SLIM model. Large discrepancies between the observed and model-predicted 01 630 nm intensities have been found for high solar activity, mainly due to an overestimate of the F-region peak heights by the SLIM model. Use of SLIM profiles normalized by actual F-region peak height and density observations essentially removed the disagreements. The reasons for the height discrepancies are discussed in terms of the longitudinal dependence of the geomagnetic control on the ExB vertical plasma drifts and the thermospheric neutral wind effects on the F-region. The effects of the magnetic declination angle on both the E x B ionospheric plasma drifts and thermospheric neutral winds at low-latitude suggest that ionospheric models need to address separately the longitudinal zones of magnetic declination either positive, negative or zero

Electron-density height profiles from the two of the experiments, one daytime, and one nighttime, are representative of quiet equatorial ionospheric conditions whereas for the third experiment the rocket was launched into a nighttime ionosphere that was disturbed by a developing plasma bubble event. Agreement between experimental results and the IRI predictions for the quiet day and night densities varies with height. Comparisons are also made with electron densities obtained from the semi-empirical Low Latitude Ionospheric Model (SLIM)

   83:  The mechanisms responsible for the formation of the alkali metal layers seem to be quite different in nature to those responsible for other atmospheric layers. In discussing the sodium layer in this context we must include both the mechanisms responsible for its basic production and the phenomena which produce structures within the layer. Although there is little doubt that the sodium layer owes its origin to the deposition into the atmosphere of extra-terrestrial material, how this deposition leads to the formation of a narrow layer of free sodium atoms is still an open question. With respect to the formation of structures within the layer it is clear that tides and gravity waves play an important role, although there can be little doubt that other factors are also at work. Of particular interest is the observation of thin layers having peak densities about an order of magnitude greater than normal, and a width an order of magnitude less. A number of mechanisms for the formation of these layers have been discussed in the literature, including direct meteor deposition, ion layer formation via the windshear mechanism, and evaporation from aerosol layers. None of these mechanisms has been analysed in detail, however, and the origin of these layers is still open to debate

The rocket attained an altitude of 524 km. The electron temperature was determined through the derivative of the current versus voltage characteristics of the Langmuir probe and the detection of the floating potential. Results are compared with the IRI model, and the divergence of the results with the model is discussed

   83:  The daily variation of the H component at Pilar (31.7 degrees S, 63.9 degrees W) and Trelew (43.3 degrees S, 65.3 degrees W) in the South American continent indicates a great variability in amplitude from season to season and even from day to day. However, Pilar always remains equatorward of the southern Sq focus. On the other hand, Trelew is in most cases slightly poleward of the Sq focus but the focus has large latitudinal excursions above and near Trelew. A cause of this variability could be the encroachment of polar ionospheric current systems into the low latitude ionospheric Sq current system

   83:  Equatorial ionospheric plasma bubble zonal velocities were measured using two 630-nm scanning photometers. Simultaneous scanning measurements were made in two east-west planes that were tilted 30ß northward and southward of the vertical. The results of measurements carried out during 5 days covering the summer equinoctial period of 1988, presented here, show evidence of marked latitudinal gradient in the bubble zonal velocities, the velocities decreasing with increasing latitude over our low-latitude observing site, Cachoeira Paulista (-28ß dip). We suggest that this velocity gradient is consistent with expectations at solar minimum, when our measurements may be associated with the region above the maximum in the eastward plasma velocity height profile

   83:  Ionosonde measurements are used to study the effects of magnetic activity on spread F and on the postsunset enhancement (Vzmax) of the F region vertical plasma drift at two longitudinally separated stations, Fortaleza and Huancayo, situated along the magnetic equator, in the American sector, during a period of high solar activity. The analysis is made for three different levels of magnetic activity. It is seen that, during the winter, Vzmax and the range spread F occurrence (RSFO) in the premidnight hours systematically increase with Kp at both locations. During the summer and equinoxes the RSFO decreases with magnetic activity in the premidnight hours and increases in the postmidnight hours, the increase being generally more pronounced during very disturbed periods. On the other hand Vzmax deduced from the ionosonde measurements shows almost no variation with magnetic activity during equinoxes and summer although during individual months of those periods both increases and decreases are seen. With the help of theoretical model calculations for the electrodynamical coupling between the equatorial E and F regions it is shown that a disturbance F region dynamo associated neutral wind could account for the variations of Vzmax with magnetic activity, that are consistently observed during winter months. On the other hand, competing influences of penetration electric fields, and/or those of disturbance meridional winds, seem to mask the expected gross effect of zonal winds in the summer and equinoctial months

   83:  Twenty three water vapour masers in the direction of IRAS sources in the southern hemisphere had their intensities monitored sistematically at Itapetinga Radio Observatory. These masers were detected in four surveys in which each run had different selection criteria. The IRAS fluxes analysis and the shape of the spectra of these masers suggest that the objetcs are associated with pre-main sequence stars, still surrounded by the dust cocoon. Almost all sources presented drastic changes in the overall spectral line distribution in their spectra

   83:  We present the results of photometric and spectroscopic observations of the cluster of galaxies SC2008-57 (A3667). The observations have resulted in a catalogue with positions and magnitudes for 203 galaxies, complete at b25=18.0 and radial velocities for 128 galaxies, 91 per cent complete at b25=17.5. The cluster can be classified as type L because its balaxy distribution is highly flattened. It shows two strong concentrations: a main concentration, centred on the cluster brightest galaxy (a D galaxy) and coincident with the peak of X-ray emission, and a substructure around the second brightest galaxy (also a D galaxy). Most of the galaxies in this substructure seem to be found to the second-brightest galaxy, forming a dynamical subunit inside the cluster. The extreme flattening of the cluster may at least partially be due to the presence of the substructure. The cluster also shows evidence for luminosity segregation, with the brightest galaxies being preferentially found in high galaxy density regions. Most of the luminosity segregation, however, is produced by galaxies associated with the two clumps around the D galaxies, suggesting that dynamical friction is effective in subclusters with low velocity dispersions and may be associated with the formation of D galaxies. The velocity dispersion of SC2008-57 is high, about 1200 km s-1, but consistent with the observed X-ray luminosity. The cluster mass, derived using several estimators, is about 2.6 x 10 15 M . Both the cluster mass and velocity dispersion may be overestimates due to the presence of the substructure

   83:  In previous attempts to show one-to-one correlation between type III bursts and X-ray spikes, there have been ambiguities as to which of several X-rays spikes are correlated with any given type III burst. Here, we present observations that show clear associations of X-ray bursts with RS type III bursts between 16:46 UT and 16:52 UT on July 9, 1985. The hard X-ray observations were made at energies above 25 keV with HXRBS on SMM and the radio observations were made at 1.63 GHz using the 13.7 m Itapetinga antenna in R and L polarization with a time resolution of 3 ms. Detailed comparison between the hard X-ray and radio observations shows: (1) In at least 13 cases we can identify the associated hard X-ray and decimetric RS bursts. (2) On average, the X-ray peaks were delayed from the peak of the RS bursts at 1.6 GHz by 400 ms although a delay as long as 1 s was observed in one case. One possible explanation of the long delays between the RS bursts and the associated X-ray is that RS bursts is produced at the leading edge of the electron beam, whereas the X-ray burst peaks at the time of arrival of the bulk of the electrons at the high density region at the lower corona and upper chromosphere. Thus, the time comparison must be made between the peak of the radio pulse and the start of the X-ray burst. In that case the delays are consistent with an electron travel time with velocity 0.3 c from the 800 MHz plasma level to the lower corona assuming that the radio emission is at the second harmonic

   83:  In July, 1985 radio observations were made at 1.6 GHz using 13.7 m Itapetinga antenna with time resolution of 3 ms. The hard X-ray observations were obtained from HXRBS on SMM. Comparison of 1.6 GHz observations with dynamic spectra in the frequency range of (1000 - 100) MHz and hard X-rays shows the following results: i) In 12 cases we identify continuation of type III-RD bursts up to 1.6 GHz suggesting presence of type III-RD at 1.6 GHz. ii) For the first time, we have identified hard X-ray peaks delayed in comparison to decimetric type III-RD bursts. These delays are longer - 1 s - than expected (100 ms) and have been interpreted assuming that the decimetric emission is at 2 nd harmonic and caused by the leading edge of the exciter, whereas peaks of X-rays have been attributed to entire entry of the exciter into the X-ray producing region

   83:  There is a lack of mm-wavelenght spectroscopic solar observations. There are suggestions that a fine structure in frequency may be superimposed on the S-component of solar active region as well as on the burst component at mm-wavelenghts. To study fine structure in frequency and time, a high sensitivity step frequency receiver operating in the frequency range 23-18 GHz with frequency resolution of 1 GHz and variable time resolution 1.2 to 96 sec, using 13.7 m diameter Itapetinga radome covered antenna, has been developed. Here, we discuss mm-wavelenght spectra of active regions and their time evolution. Study of time evolution of an active region AR 5569 observed on 29th June, 1989 suggests existence of fine structures as a function of time

   83:  Solar radio observations at 1.6 GHz were carried out in the month of July, 1985 by using 13.7 m diameter Itapetinga antenna with time resolution of 3 ms. Homologous Bursts, with total duration of about couple of seconds and repeated by some seconds were observed associated with Homologous H-  flares. These H-  flares were having periodicities of about 40 min. Observed long periodocities were attributed to oscillation of prominences, and small periods were attributed to removal of plasma from the field interaction zone. Also observed are "Homologous-Like" bursts. These bursts are double peak bursts with same time profile repeating in time. In addition to this, the ratio of the total duration of the burts to time difference in the peaks of bursts remain constant. Morphological studies of these bursts have been presented

Quando uma maquina em operacao falha, ela e enviada a estacao de reparo composta de um unico servidor imediatamente substituida por uma maquina de reserva, se disponivel. O servidor tem dois tipos de reparo disponiveis para usar na maquina que falhou. Existem custos de espera das maquinas na fila de reparo, custos de reparo, custos de perda de producao e custos de troca do tipo de reparo. Este trabalho trata do seguinte problema de decisao: obter uma politica estacionaria que determine o tipo de reparo a ser utilizado, em funcao do estado do sistema, de maneira a minimizar o custo medio esperado a longo prazo quando os tempos de falha e reparo tem distribuicao de Cox de ordem 2. Este problema de controle e representado por um modelo de decisao semi-markoviano. O Algoritmo de Iteracao de Politicas e o Algoritmo de Iteracao de Valores sao usados para obtencao da politica otima. Apresentam-se resultados numericos para estes dois metodos de otimizacao

Extrapolation in future indicated for 2000-2030 a departure of (+0.4 degree C) above the 1950-70 level. However, for the 1980s, the observed values are above the expected level, probably indicating large greenhouse effects due to human intervention. In that case, our predictions would be underestimates

   83:  In a search for obscured active galactic nuclei we selected 144 x-ray/infrared emitting galaxies. Optical spectroscopy of this sample is presented. A classification according to the nuclear activity shows that 28 are AGN, 39 are transition-type objects and 44 are H ii region-like galaxies. Three of the 28 AGN are Seyfert 1 galaxies and the others are of Type 2. We suggest that the objects identified as narrow line AGN are obscured Seyfert 1. Most of the observed galaxies are seen edge-on, indicating that dust may have a flattened distribution coplanar to the disk of the parent galaxy. With the inclusion of the newly identified AGN, the sample of the x-ray emitting Seyfert 2 galaxies is fairly complete above a flux limit of log FHX  - 10. 8

   83:   Na complexidade da vida social atual, com suas atividades industriais, agricolas, transportes e ate turisticas, os fenomenos atmosferico podem adquirir muita importancia sobretudo em situacoes dramaticas. O trabalho de previsao meteorologica que ja se desenvolve no Brasil com uma certa tradicao comeca a exigir uma modernizacao e uma estruturacao de seus servicos de forma que seja capaz de enfrentar requisitos ainda mais rigorosos, para aumentar sua produtividade, eficiencia e confiabilidade. Estas caracteristicas devem estar presentes tanto no sistema de previsao para longo prazo como na previsao local e imediata (nowcasting). Assim sendo, so o emprego de alta tecnologia em sensoriamento, computacao e processamento grafico interativo, podera suprir necessidade operacionais, que entre outras, sao marcadas pela exigencia de um monitoramento em tempo real, em tres dimensoes, numa escala regional. O objetivo maior e conduzir a normalizacao dos servicos dentro de padroes modernos, provendo detecoes mais confiaveis de fenomenos severos, podendo consequentemente produzir ALERTAS DE TEMPO. As informacoes fornecidas devem dar suporte desde a protecao de vidas ate a decisoes relacionadas a produtividade economica. Este esforco, porem exige o tracado de um plano estrategio de desenvolvimento e de implantacao que bem se adapte ao Brasil. O projeto proposto de uma rede moderna e estruturada de sistemas regionais para a previsao de tempo de curto prazo, abrangente em dados, e que integre interativamente seus produtos com grande versatilidade, de certo proporcionara servicos que combinarao produtividade com eficiencia

The correlation coefficients were generally high (>+0.90) except for some slabs in some longitude belts, when correlations were lower, indicating these slabs as possible sources of some stray, transient currents. However, deltaHo, i.e. the intercepts on the deltaHo axis, were always negative for all slabs, indicating that, if a steady current existed, it should be above the ground, but below 340 km altitude

Deblending of the Halfa+[N ii] profiles was performed using, when available, the [O iii]lambda5007 profile shape as a template. Line profile measurements, as well as line intensities, are tabulated. We found to be relatively common among the observed objects the existence of structure in the line cores, pointing to the complexity of dynamics in the low-velocity emission region. Differences in profile shape and width amongst different lines are also common, indicating that often there is a superposition, on the spectrograph slit, of emission regions with different dynamics and excitation conditions. This superposition is quantified  in the case of IC 5063. We found weak, broad H alfa emission in IC 5063 and IC 5135. In NGC 2992, we were unable to confirm the presence of a broad H alfa component with the same intensity as found by previous authors, which we ascribe to spectral resolution effects

Optical spectroscopy of the nuclear region of the selected galaxies revealed that 76  of them show emission lines. Classification of the spectra according to the widths and line intensity ratios shows that there are 34 AGN, 34 transition type objects and 43 nuclear HII-like region galaxies. Among the AGN, three are Seyfert type 1 and the others are type 2 objects. We suggest that the objects identified as narrow line AGN are obscured Seyfert 1

The telescope incorporated a passive collimator and was mounted on a stabilized platform which allowed observations with a pointing accuracy of approximately 2 degrees in azimuth. The flight altitude was about 5.5 mb and the total observation time was 6 hours, divided between source and background. The 2 sigma upper limits for the continuum are 2.45x10-5 and 5.42x 10-6 photons cm-2 s-1 keV-1 in the 0.15 to 0.30 MeV and 0.30 to 1.00 MeV energy bands, respectively

Este sistema e uma ferramenta para a construcao de interfaces em LN para sistemas especialistas. A partir de um conhecimento lexicosemantico-pragmatico vazio, o IDEAL constroi, na interacao dinamica com o usuario, um universo linguistico suficiente para a tarefa de compreender, interpretar e traduzir frases em LN para dada representacao de conhecimento num dominio particular de aplicacao. Sob a otica de processos integrados de analise, interpretacao e traducao, a medida que as frases forem sendo respondidas, o IDEAL incorporara as relacoes abstraidas das respostas, aumentando o poder de interpretacao da interface. Serao constantemente reavaliados pesos determinados preliminares, os quais funcionarao como "guias" de analise e interpretacao, construindo-se um subconjunto lexical e de regras vigentes para dados tipos de usuario e para dado dominio de conhecimento

During the last period in 1985 the Bureau des Longitudes organized a campaign of observation, and the Laborat¢rio Nacional de Astrof°sica in Brazil joined it. This paper gives an analysis of the results obtained

   83:  Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) of annual spots series for 1700-1987 (288 points) indicated the most prominent peak at T=10.91 years, followed by T=10.62, 10.00 and 103 years of comparable amplitudes and twelve others of smaller amplitudes, all significant at a 3sigma a priori level. MacDonald (1989) has suggested that the method of spectral analysis should depend upon the choice of the chosen model. However, our results compare well with his results from a periodogram study, indicating that the choice of the model, generally difficult in geophysical problems, is not vital. Since amplitude estimates in MESA are unreliable, our prescription is to use MESA only for detecting possible periodicities and then, estimate amplitudes and phases by a separate Multiple Regression Analysis

Com este proposito sao construidos modelos de regressao linear multipla, expressando a precipitacao em termos de paramentros meteorologicos relacionados as frentes tais como, contraste termico, contraste de umidade e vorticidade ciclonica. Foram examinadas as cartas sinoticas e de ar supeior do periodo de tres anos, 1986-1988, para se identificar os Sistemas frontais que passam sobre o RS e para coletar os dados meteorologicos associados a tais episodios. A media da precipitacao acumulada de 24 horas entre 18 estacoes espalhadas sobre o RS e a variavel dependente e os parametros meterologicos atras da frente (Buenos Aires) e adiante da frente (Rio de Janeiro) e as combinacoes entre elas sao variaveis independentes. Ha quatro conjunto de dados para cada estacao do ano

Em Rodeio Velho, as sondagens confirmam a presenca de centenas de metros de sedimentos, provavelmente afetados por estruturas verticais e alternancia de camadas resistiva e condutora. Na regiao de Santa Maria, as sondagens nas areas mineralizadas apresentaram uma camada intermediaria mais condutora, que aproximadamente coincide com a posicao da camada mineralizada

   83:  The intensities of several water vapor masers in the direction of HII regions were monitored, almost on a monthly basis, from December 1980 to December 1986. The spectral shape of all sources changed in time with the fluxes of individual velocity components varying on timescales of 106 to 107 sec. We discuss the evolutionary stage and the dynamics of three of the monitored sources: G331.5-0.1, GGD25 (NGC6334C) and Orion A

   83:  Analisa-se as caracteristicas ondulatorias basicas dos disturbios equatoriais de leste sobre o Oceano Atlantico Equatorial Sul, proximo a costa da America do Sul, durante o First GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program) Global Experiment (FGGE). Foram utilizados dados do National Meteorological Center (NMC) e dados de radiacao de onda longa (ROL). Analises de diagramas tipo "Hovmoller" da componente meridional do vento revelam disturbios ondulatorios se propagando para oeste com velocidade de fase entre 10 a 12 m/s, periodo entre 5 a 6 dias, e comprimento de onda de 4800 km a 6200 km. Ha sinais de disturbios durante todo o ano. No outono ocorrem as ondas mais curtas, enquanto no inverno ocorrem as ondas mais longas. As analises mostram disturbios em ROL com periodos entre 10 a 30 e entre 30 a 60 dias. Os espectros de potencia da componente meridional do vento apresentam picos no intervalo de 3 a 5 dias em 5 S. Estes picos se destacam mais na estacoes de outono e inverno, em torno de 20 W e 25 W. Os espectros cruzados indicam ondas se propagando para oeste com a velocidade de 9m5 m/s e comprimento de onda de 3300 km durante o trimetre MAM, e velocidade de 15 m/s e comprimento de 5200 km durante o trimestre JJA

Ce chercheur en oceanographie physique est de nationalite bresilienne; il est fonctionnaire de l'Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) de Sao Jose dos Campos Sao Paulo, Bresil. Il occupa durant cette periode de 6 mois un poste de d'accueil de courte duree au sein de l'ORSTOM. Le travail presente ici s'integre dans le cadre du programme OPERA qui est une action de TOCA_France soutenue par le PNEDC. Il fut originellement propose au Departement T.O.A. de l'ORSTOM par Jacques Servain (ORSTOM/Brest). Ce dernier, ainsi que Alain Morliere (ORSTOM/Brest) collaborerent a sa realisation. Cette etude est un exemple de la cooperation internationale entre l'ORSTOM (France) et l'INPE (Bresil) dans le cadre du programme TOGA

O modelo foi usado para verificar o desempenho esperado de pecas com diferentes valores de condutividade em microondas. Os resultados mostraram-se concordantes com as medidas de refletividade obtidas anteriormente, pelo metodo de arco, durante a fase de relizacao experimental dos absorvedores, quando a concentracao de negro de fumo foi sendo variada em busca de maiores atenuacoes do eco

   83:   Neste trabalho foram realizados experimentos numericos de frontogenese utilizando um modelo numerico multinivel de area limitada. Como forcante frontogenetica foi utilizada a deformacao horizontal do escoamento. Foram realizadas simulacoes numericas para uma atmosfera seca e com os efeitos de parametrizacao do calor latente de condensacao. Os dois experimentos geraram frontogenese nos niveis inferiores e, tambem um jato paralelo a frente nos niveis superiores a esquerda da posicao da frontogeneses na superficie. A inclusao da parametrizacao do calor latente gerou uma frontogenese mais intensa, o movimento vertical tornou-se mais forte intensificando a convergencia na regiao frontogenetica. Houve uma intensificacao do jato nos altos niveis, sem no entanto mudar sua posicao em relacao ao experimento seco

   83:   Este estudo trata da Instabilidade Simetrica Condicional, das condicoes necessarias para sua deteccao, dos metodos para sua avaliacao e da possivel relacao com casos de banda de precipitacao sobre o Estado de Sao Paulo. As analises sao feitas atraves de radiossondagens e de mapas de radar meteorologico. Os resultados indicam que a organizacao de faixas de precipitacao de moderada a intensa, entre 30 e 70 Km de largura, conhecidas como bandas amplas, pode estar associada a presenca de uma camada rasa (entre a troposfera media e superior) com instabilidade potencial provavelmente resultante de Instabilidade Simetrica Condicional. O ar subjacente e geralmente condicionalmente estavel ou quase neutro. O metodo mais simples para a determinacao da Instabilidade Simetrica Condicional e obtido quantificando a "Slantwise Convective Available Potencial Energy" - SCAPE, atraves de uma radiossondagem. Verifica-se que ha SCAPE - 0 em 85

   83:   Neste trabalho desenvolveu-se um modelo nao-linear multinivel de equacoes primitivas em coordenadas verticais eta (n). Este modelo e usado para estudar a influencia da Cordilheira dos Andes na circulacao atmosferica de verao sobre a America do Sul gerado pela forcante termica tropical localizada no Brasil Central e Sul da America. Incluindo ou excluindo os Andes o modelo reproduz muito bem as principais caracteristicas da circulacao de verao em alta troposfera, tais como a formacao da Alta de Bolivia e o Cavado sobre o Nordeste do Brasil. Em Baixos niveis encontrou-se que os Andes favorece a formacao de uma faixa de convergencia de orientacao NW-SE, na posicao climatologica da Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul (ZCAS), o que sugere a hipotese que a conveccao sobre o Brasil Central e na Amazonia deve ser um dos fatores principais para a formacao da ZCAS e a presenca dos Andes seria um dos fatores que controlam seu posicionamento climatologico. Na presenca dos Andes tambem o modelo reproduz a formacao da "Baixa do Chaco" aproximadamente em sua posicao climatologica. Finalmente os resultados do modelo sugerem a existencia de uma forte interacao entre o escoamento do oeste em altos niveis sobre o Oceano Pacifico e a circulacao da Alta da Bolivia gerada pela fonte termica, principalmente na sua borda sul. Este ultimo resultado pode ter implicacoes sobre o deslocamento dos cavalos associados as frentes frias sobre a America do Sul

   83:   A resposta sobre a America do Sul a uma intensa perturbacao que se move sobre o Oceano Atlantico Tropical Norte (com liberacao de calor latente comparavel aquela associada a furacoes) e investigada usando um modelo nao-linear semilagrangino de equacoes primitivas de duas camadas. Os resultados do modelo  evidenciam um possivel acoplamento com sistemas frontais oriundos do Hemisferio Sul e a explosao convectiva que ocorre no Brasil central e oeste da Amazonia. A medida que o disturbio move-se para noroeste ao longo do Oceano Atlantico Tropical Norte, os ventos de altos (baixos) niveis de orientacao norte/nordeste (sul/sudeste) tornam-se mais intensos na costa norte do Brasil, em oposicao a circulacao tipicamente observada nesta regiao no periodo de agosto a outubro. Paralelamente a esta inversao da circulacao, aparece um centro de baixa pressao bem definido nas regioes central, norte e nordeste do Brasil. Os resultados tambem evidenciam a importancia dos termos nao-lineares na dinamica da evolucao do fenomeno: o cisalhamento vertical intenso inibe a resposta local e inter-hemisferica, assim como ocorre no caso em que o furacao esta imerso em um estado basico com intensa vorticidade anticiclonica. Estes efeitos nao-lineares podem ser relacionados ao termo da divergencia e da adveccao vertical na equacao da vorticidade

   83:   Este trabalho analisa a variabilidade espacial e temporal das componentes atmosfericas do ciclo hidrologico da regiao Amazonia durante o segundo experimento meteorologico Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE-2B), realizado entre 13 de abril a 13 de maio de 1987. Foram utilizados dados de radiossondas nos horarios sinoticos obtido por seis estacoes da regiao (Belem, Manaus, Boa Vista, Tabatinga, Vilhena e Alta Floresta). Utilizou-se tambem dados de precipitacao coletados em varios locais da bacia amazonica. A analise da agua precipitavel (wp) revela que: a) existe uma grande variabilidade espacial do vapor d'agua na Amazonia, sendo as regioes central, norte e centro oeste as mais umidas, e a sudeste a mais seca; b) o ciclo diario e relativamente fraco, nao excedendo 10
   83:   em relacao a media diaria de Wp e; c) ocorre uma grande variabilidade interdiaria. O campo do transporte do vapor d'agua indica que, em geral, a componente de leste domina sobre a Amazonia como um todo. As variacoes interdiarias do fluxo de vapor de agua verticalmente integrado, aparentemente, estao associadas a passagem de sistemas meteorologicos, tais como linhas de instabilidade, pela regiao. Analise da divergencia do fluxo de vapor d'agua indica que em media a Amazonia e dominada pela convergencia de vapor d'agua (E  P), ou seja, essa regiao atua como um sumidouro de vapor d'agua. Entretanto, quando subdivide-se a regiao em duas sub-regioes, observa-se que no norte a evapotranspiracao e mais importante para precipitacao local do que a convergencia de vapor d'agua. No Sul, ocorre a situacao oposta, ou seja, a convergencia de vapor d'agua e maior que a evapotranspiracao. A evapotranspiracao total na regiao, durante o periodo estudado, estimada via residuo da equacao de balanco de vapor d'agua, foi de 108.7 mm

Na estacao seca de 1985 (setembro-outubro), a variacao no armazenamento de agua foi de (-27,4 mais ou menos 6,6) mm, na camada de (0-170) cm, e a absorcao radicular mais intensa ocorreu entre (50-120) cm de solo, devido a compactacao nas profundidades entre (20-40)cm. Na floresta, mesmo durante a estacao das chuvas, (janeiro-abril), em resposta a pequenas estiagens, observou-se a absorcao de agua pela vegetacao nas camadas superficiais, interrompendo temporariamente o processo de drenagem profunda. Durante o periodo seco de 1985, a variacao no armazenamento foi de (-57,0 mais ou menos 7,0) mm, abrangendo todo o perfil de (0-170) cm; embora o conteudo de umidade tenha sido superior a 60
   83:   da capacidade de armazenamento de agua pelo solo. A taxa media de evapotranspiracao diaria da floresta estimada em 1985, foi de (3,4 mais ou menos 0,4) mm/dia; no seringal, a estimativa obtida foi de (2,5 mais ou menos 0,6) mm/dia, correspondendo a uma diferenca de 27

   82:  <REGIAO NORDESTE - BRASIL>
   83:  Neste trabalho e realizado um estudo das caracteristicas climatologicas da precipitacao sobre o leste da Regiao Nordeste do Brasil. Em termos de distribuicao espacial, o periodo de maio e junho representa a estacao chuvosa com 30
   83:   da precipitacao anual que ocorre nestes dois meses. O periodo de quatro meses, de abril a julho, explica 60
   83:   da precipitacao anual. observou-se que a caracteristica tipica desta regiao e a incidencia de eventos extremos (secas e enchentes), o que indica que ha uma variacao interanual relativamente grande. os principais processos responsaveis pela variacao interanual da precipitacao desta regiao sao: 1) a posicao e a intensidade do sistema de alta pressao no Atlantico Sul, como revelado pelas variacoes do vento a superficie na Ilha de Trindade e em Abrolhos; 2) a ocorrencia ou ausencia de El Nino, dado pelo indice de Oscilacao Sul (IOS) e 3) a variacao de temperatura da superficie do mar (TSM) no Atlantico Subtropical. Conclui-se que o IOS nao se correlaciona bem com a variacao interanual da precipitacao sobre o leste do nordeste do Brasil. O vento a superficie na Ilha de Trindade e em Abrolhos correlaciona-se bem com a variacao interanual da precipitacao nesta regiao. Isto mostra que a posicao e a intensidade da Alta Subtropical do Atlantico Sul tem uma influencia em controlar a precipitacao nesta regiao. Os altos valores da correlacao com "lag" entre o vento a superficie nestas duas estacoes e a precipitacao no leste do Nordeste do Brasil sugere a utilidade deste parametro para a previsao de longo prazo da precipitacao nesta regiao. A relacao entre a TSM no Atlantico Tropical e a precipitacao mostra que uma configuracao tipo dipolo, com temperaturas mais altas (baixas) no sul (norte) do Atlantico, e favoravel a precipitacao maior (menor). Embora isto seja qualitativamente similar ao que foi notado por Hastenrath e Heller (1977) e por Moura e Shukla (1981), os detalhes dos centros de maiores correlacoes sao diferentes.

   83:  The annual mean sea-level time series for Stockholm (Sweden) for 1825-1984 (160 data points) had a large long-term negative (almost linear, only slightly quadratic) trend. After correcting for the same, the detrended series was subjected to maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA). Choosing selected periodicities for further multiple regression analysis, series for the first 80 yr (1825-1904) showed periodicities at T=2.40, 5.0, 6.1, 13.5, 14.8 and 32 yr, significant at a 2 sigma level. The three largest peaks (italicized) had amplitudes of approximately (2.5-3.0) +- 0.8 cm. The latter 80 yr (1905-1984) showed significant periodicities at T= 2.05, 2.7, 3.0, 3.6, 4.4, 5.5, 6.3, 7.7, 9.8, 20.5 and 33 yr. The three largest peaks (italicized) had amplitudes of approximately (2.0-2.5) +- 0.7 cm. The whole period of 160 yr (1825-1984) showed significant periodicities at T= 2.05, 2.9, 3.2, 4.5, 4.9, 5.6, 6.4, 7.8, 11.0, 13.7, 14.8, 29 and 43 yr. The three largest peaks (italicized) had amplitudes of approximately (1.6-1.9) +- 0.6 cm. All these significant peaks explained a variance of only about 30
   83:   or less, indicating a large random component of approximately 70
   83:  . Peaks at T=11 yr (sunspot cycle) or T=18.6 yr (lunar nodal term) were either absent or very weak. Most of the other peaks were transient (present in the first 80 yr or the latter 80 yr) except an uncertain quasibiennal oscillation (QBO) (T=2-3 yr) and T= 5-6 yr and T= 30 yr, which seemed to be persistent throughout the whole period. Some periodicities seem to resemble those seen in the Southern Oscillation (SO) index

   83:  Plots of monthly median noon time foF2 values at Manila, Kodaikanal and Vanimo vs solar EUV flux (170-190 Angstrom), smoothed sunspot number R12 and smoothed solar radio noise (10.7 cm) flux indicate saturation effects in the foF2 vs sunspot plots. The saturation diminishes in the foF2 vs solar radio noise plots and disappears for foF2 vs solar EUV plots. Thus, in the absence of EUV data, solar radio noise could be a reasonably good substitute, better than sunspots, for predicting foF2 values on time scales of one month, or more

   83:  A comparison of monthly mean values of total ozone at South Pole, Buenos Aires (Argentina), Cachoeira Paulista and Natal (Brazil), and Huancayo (Peru) revealed that whereas South Pole showed an ozone depletion of 45
   83:   in October 1987 (as compared to October, 1977), Buenos Aires showed a small decrease (10
   83:  ) while the other locations showed very small decreases (1-2
   83:  ). When daily values are considered, the Antarctic ozone hole of October 1987 seems to have caused 10
   83:   depletion at Buenos Aires and 5
   83:   at Natal and Huancayo in December 1987. However, a  large part of this is normal seasonal variation, except at Huancayo, where a residual effect of 5

   83:  During solar cycle 21 (1976-86), the primary solar irradiance at 300 nm was steady during 1980-82 and thereafter decreased until 1986 by only 2-3
   83:  . The stratospheric ozone in middle latitudes had a QBO of 3-4
   83:   in this interval but the long-term ozone trend was less than 3
   83:   per decade, which could result in a UVB increase of only 5-6
   83:   per decade. Thus the combined effect of changes in primary solar irradiance and ozone changes could be an increase of 5-6
   83:   in UVB, observed at ground during 1977-81 and a steady level during 1981-86. During 1976-86, the average cloudiness changed by less than 5
   83:   indicating UVB changes of 5
   83:   or less on this count. The aerosol level was almost constant during 1976-82 and increased abruptly in 1982 due to the El Chichon eruption and decayed slowly until 1986. Thus, due to aerosols only, the UVB was expected to be constant during 1976-82, to decrease sharply in 1982 and to recoup slowly thereafter. Measurements of clear-sky solar UVB at ground made at Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps, 47 degrees N, 8 degrees E) during 1981-89 and at Rockville, USA (39 degrees N, 77 degrees W) were not comparable between themselves and did not follow the above expected patterns. Neither did the all-day R-B meter UVB measurements at Philadelphia, USA (40 degrees N, 75 degrees W) and Minneapolis, USA (45 degrees N, 93 degrees W). We suspect that some of these measurements are erroneous. This needs further detailed scrutiny

   83:  Neste trabalho fez-se um estudo observacional das caracteristicas das ondas baroclinicas de escala media (numero de onda de 4 a 7) que frequentemente dominam a atmosfera de verao do Hemisferio Sul. Este estudo tambem detalha a evolucao das ondas de escala media durante um ciclo de vida particular. Os coeficientes de correlacao entre o vento meridional e temperatura e entre o vento meridional e zonal medem a eficiencia do transporte de calor e momentum, respectivamente. As eficiencias sao calculadas para os estagios de desenvolvimento e decaimento da onda baroclinica. A onda fica mais eficiente em transportar calor aproximadamente um dia antes de atingir o maximo em energia cinetica. O aumento na variancia da componente zonal do vento esta associado com pequeno transporte de momentum, fazendo com que a eficiencia desse transporte diminua. A energetica das ondas de media escala foi estudada atraves das equacoes de Saltzman (1957). O calculo da energia mostra ciclos de vida bem definidos, com decaimento barotropico. O termo de conversao entre a energia potencial disponivel turbulenta e energia cinetica (   '  ') foi calculado atraves da equacao da vorticidade quase-geostrofica para omega (componente vertical da velocidade do vento) e aproximacao hidrostatica para alfa (volume especifico). Para omega' alfa' menor que zero tem-se aumento de energia cinetica turbulenta devido a transformacao de energia potencial disponivel que diminui. A validade da aproximacao geostrofica e hidrostatica e examinada na troposfera de verao do Hemisferio Sul. O erro geostrofico no transporte de calor e menor do que no transporte de momentum

   83:  Este trabalho analisa a variabilidade e as teleconexoes especiais e temporais do campo de vorticidade relativa durante o verao do Hemisferio Sul 1979/1980. Utilizaram-se ventos em pontos de grade analisados pelo NMC no nivel de 200 hPa, no dominio espacial limitado pelos meridianos 0 graus e 180 graus W e pelas latitudes 19,6 graus N e 44,6 graus S. Espectros de potencia e espectro cruzados das seris temporais de vorticidade relativa identificaram que os periodos de 30-60 dias, 12-15 dias, 7,5-8,5 dias e 4,8-5,7 sao significativos. As series temporais foram filtradas em 3 faixas espectrais com periodos de 2,5-6 dias, maiores que 10 dias e de 30 a 60 dias. Estas series indicam que a regiao sudeste do Brasil, associada a Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul (ZCAS), apresenta a maior variabilidade. Na faixa espectral de 2,5-6 dias as perturbacoes extratropicais constituem os principais mecanismos que induzem ao padrao de comportamento da Alta da Bolivia (AB), da Zona de Convergencia do Pacifico Sul (ZCPS) e da ZCAS. Neste caso, existe uma alta correlacao positiva entre a ZCAS e a Baixa do Atlantico Tropical (BAT). Um trem de ondas que emana da AB parece confirmar a hipotese de que a genese da BAT ocorre a partir da AB. Resultados na faixa espectral com periodo maior que 10 dias mostram que a ZCAS e BAt apresentam fortes modulacoes; teleconexoes entre a ZCPS e a ZCAS sao evidentes. A analise das Componentes Principais Rotacionais revela que a ZCPS e a ZCAS sao geradas pela interacao entre sistemas de latitudes extratropicais e tropicais. Teleconexoes na faixa de 30-60 dias mostram a propagacao do sinal para leste a partir da ZCPS. A ZCAS apresenta uma resposta muito intensa, que se propaga aparentemente para a regiao da BAT

   87:  CIRCULACAO OCEANICA
   87:  SIMULACAO NUMERICA
   83:   Este trabalho desenvolve em detalhe uma nova metodologia para a simulacao numerica da circulacao dos oceanos tropicais. Especificamente, considera-se as equacoes linearizadas de agua rasa sobre o plano-B equatorial, que podem ser usadas para descrever a dependencia horizontal de cada modo baroclinico em uma expansao em modos normais verticais. Um problema de valores de contorno geral para estas equacoes, com condicoes de contorno de deslizamento em uma fronteira de geometria arbitraria, e  reformulado como uma equacao integral de contorno cuja incognita e a distribuicao de pressoes ao longo da fronteira. Desta maneira, obtem-se equacoes integrais que descrevem a circulacao forcada pelo vento e tambem problemas de espalhamento de ondas equatoriais livres por ilhas e margens continentais de geometria arbitraria. Os nucleos dos operadores integrais que aparecem nas equacoes integrais de contorno sao representados analiticamente por expansoes em ondas equatoriais livres, as quais envolvem funcoes de Hermite                 e a latitude nao-dimensional. Em certos casos de interesse, torna-se inconveniente computar os nucleos atraves destas expansoes, devido a sua lenta convergencia. Fisicamente, isto decorre da superposicao de ondas equatoriais com numeros de onda complexos (modos amortecidos zonalmente). Uma teoria geral e desenvolvida para o calculo assintotico do resto de uma expansao em funcoes de Hermite, quando a serie e truncada apos um numero suficientemente grande de termos. Esta teoria, que e aplicavel a uma variedade de expansao de relevancia oceanografica, permite realizar eficientemente o calculo numerico dos nucleos dos operadores integrais. Procedimentos para a solucao numerica das equacoes integrais de contorno atraves do metodo dos elementos de contorno sao desenvolvidos, e implementados na forma de um conjunto de rotinas em FORTRAN 77. Vantagens da presente formulacao incluem a possibilidade de calcular a solucao apenas em regioes selecionadas do oceano, a facilidade na representacao de geometrias costeiras complexas e o tratamento unificado de todas as frequencias de interesse oceanografico sem o uso de aproximacao como a de ondas longas e a de baixas frequencias e a de baixas frequencia. A nova metodologia e ilustrada atraves do estudo do espalhamento de ondas de Rossby equatoriais com periodo entre 50 e 90 dias pelo contorno oeste do oceano Atlantico Tropical. Alguns dos padroes de interferencia resultantes exibem uma regiao de grande amplitude de oscilacao,cujo centro esta situado entre 3-9 graus N, 35-47 graus N. Encontra-se evidencia de que este efeito decorre da interferencia construtica de modos zonalmente amortecidos, excitados ao sul do equador ao longo do contorno oceanico

The short-time variability of the H2O maser together with the absence of compact radio continuum emission suggests that the excitation energy of the maser could originate from an O7-O9 protostar in its earlier evolutionary stages

   83:  X- and gamma-ray astronomy experiments which employ rectangular URA coded masks alone show artifacts in the images reconstructed due to nonuniform background levels in the detector plane. The employment of a separate antimask in addition to the mask in observations is useful to eliminate this problem. We propose here a method to implement the antimask with the same mask, utilizing the antisymmetric properties in the mask pattern, thereby avoiding the need for a separate antimask in an experiment. Simulations performed with this mask-antimask system are presented to show its advantages

We also discuss recent spectroscopic observations which reveal a very short orbital period (85 min) phased with the photometric period. On the basis of the results we argue that the system belongs to the class of magnetized cataclysmic variables

   83:  The details of a balloon experiment conducted to measure gama ray flux in the energy range 0.15-5.00 MeV in continuun and line emission from supernova SN1987A are presented. The telescope employed two NaI(T1) detectors with geometrical area 649 cm2, and mechanical collimators which defined a field of view of 25 degrees for gamma rays of energy below 300 keV. The detector assembly was mounted on an alt-azimuth platform with capability to monitor any celestial object in its trajectory with stabilization accuracy 1 degree in azimuth and <- 0.5 degree in elevation. The expected sensivity (2sigma) of the telescope for observations of objects at elevation angles of >- 45 degrees and at float altitudes of 4.5 mbar for duration of 3 hours. is 2.45x10-5 and 5.42 x 10-6 photons.cm-2s-1 keV-1, in the nominal energy ranges of 150 to 300 keV and 300 to 1000 keV, respectively

   83:   Neste trabalho realizaram-se experimentos com parametrizacoes de cumuli rasos e profundos. Para isso foi utilizado um modelo unidimensional, constituido de uma coluna vertical com parametrizacoes de processos rediativos, superficie, difusao turbulenta de grande escala e conveccoes profundas (esquema de Kuo, 1974) e rasa (esquemas de Tiedke, 1984 e Albrecht et al., 1986). As  condicoes iniciais do modelo foram dados de uma radiossondagem da cidade de Manaus-AM. Na primeira parte foi utilizado o esquema de Tiedke com o modelo completo. Observou-se o desenvolvimento de cumuli profundos durante o periodo diurno, em resposta a fonte de umidade em superficie (evaporacao). O aumento de valor dos coeficientes de difusividade, do esquema de Tiedke, diminuiu a intensidade dos cumuli profundos. A incorporacao da convergencia de unidade de grande escala, em baixos niveis, via forcante externo, itensificou a conveccao e aumentou a taxa de precipitacao. A implementacao do esquema de Albrecht et al. associado ao de Kuo. estando os demais processos desativados, mostrou-se uma boa combinacao. Entretanto, a intensa difusao vertical de grande escala por processos secos nao permitiu que os cumuli rasos fossem ativados, quando o modelo completo foi integrado. A versatilidade do esquema de Albrecht et al. foi verificadas ataves da variacao dos parametros inerentes ao esquema (Taxa de entranhamento, umidade relativa critica, etc.)

   83:   During the Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) - Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE) 2B campaign in the Amazon basin, samples of rainwater and throughfall were obtained in a "terra firme" (non flooded forest) rain forest at the Ducke Reserve (2 degrees 57'S, 59 degrees 58'W). The samples were collected during one wet period (April 1 to May 13, 1987) and one dry period (August 1 to October 1, 1987). All samples were analyzed for Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, Amonium, Chloride Sulfhate, and pH. The rainwater was acidic, with a volume-weighted mean pH of 4.6 for the two periods. Rainwater input from the dry period was two times greater for Sodio, Magnesio, Amonio and Sulfato and about four times greater for Potassium than from the wet period. The ionic concentrations in throughfall were higher than those in rainwater, except for Amonium during the dry period. This enrichment of throughfall is attributed to the interaction of precipitation with the forest canopy

   83:   This work discusses the ion budget for a "terra firme" rainforest ecosystem in Central Amazonia, during two periods of contrasting rainfall. The samples (rainwater, thoughfall, litter solution, soil solution and river water) were collected during April-May and August-September 1987, at Reserva Ducke (2o57'S, 59o58'W), near Manaus.The budget indicates that the ionic species (Na+, K+, Mg2+, NH+4, C1-and SO -) are found mainly in the portions of the hydrological cycles which cross the aerial phytomass and percolate throughout the root zone, showing the existence of a closed mineral cycle

   83:   Um modelo de equacoes de agua rasa de area limitada no plano beta equatorial e usado para se implementar o metodo de iniciacao dinamica por modos normais. Tal metodo e equivalente a iniciacao nao-linear por modos normais de Machenhauer. Para se obter o equilibrio dinamico entre os campos, o modelo e integrado em torno do tempo inicial com um esquema avancado-atrasado, mantendo-se os termos nao-lineares e o forcante fisico constantes durante cada etapa e efetuando-se uma media ponderada no final de cada iteracao. para isso o termo dissipativo deve ser tratado como nao-linear, a fim de nao se comprometer a estabilidade numerica do esquema. O modelo e integrado ate um dia utilizando dados simulados e reais decompostos para o modo vertical de altura equivalente proximo de 250m. Sao estudados os efeitos da discretizacao do modelo em uma grade justaposta e a fonte de calor e decomposta em modos verticais, mostrando ser esta equivalente a uma fonte de massa para as equacoes da estrutura horizontal. Dois tipos de forcantes sao  descritos: pre-fixado e o parametrizado ("WAVE-CISK"), que e proporcional a divergencia. Os resultados obtidos  representam bem as caracteristicas da circulacao de altos niveis ppara o verao do hemisferio sul, onde sao filtradas as ondas de gravidade e os ruidos

   83:   Existem poucos estudos de observacoes multiespectraiscom alta sensibilidade e resolucao em tempo/frequencia/energia. A importancia de tais investigacoes e que estes estudos nos permitem observar o desenvolvimento do fenomeno associado simultaneamente em varias alturas na atmosfera solar, e do qual podemos obter informacoes sobre a regiao de aceleracao, propagacao de particulas aceleradas na direcao da fotosfera, e coroa e emissao causada por essas particulas. Essas informacoes podem nos explicar melhor os processos de liberacao de energia no flare solar. Nos investigamos aqui, explosoes solares em H- , raios-X, microondas, ondas decimetricas e metricas, na fase impulsiva do flare. Os estudos simultaneos das explosoes solares de ondas milimetricas e metricas e suas estruturas-finas, tem sugerido que as particulas sao aceleradas para energias de ate ' 200 KeV; estruturas-finas sao geradas por particulas aceleradas em processos secundarios. Alem disso aquecimento e aceleracao ocorrem simultaneamente no flare solar. As observacoes foram realizadas com a antena de 13,7m de diametro de Atibaia, pela primeira vez operando na faixa de decimetricas (1663 MHz) com alta sensibilidade e resolucao temporal. Nos observamos pela primeira vez: i)blips acima de 1000 MHz, ii) explosoes homologas-like em microondas e spikes de baixa intensidade de fluxo. As investigacoes mostraram que blips sao variantes das explosoes tipo III e sao geradas pela interacao do feixe de eletros com plasma, no segundo harmonico. Spikes sao gerados por ECM, e, assumindo-se a instabilidade MHD as dimensoes de fonte sao estimadas em 50 Km. Os flares homologos-like de periodo longos de repeticao (-40min), sao explicados pela oscilacao de proeminencia, como tambem os homologos de periodos curtos de repeticao (- 10s). Investigacoes mais detalhadas dessas explosoes apresentadas aqui, leva-nos finalmente a sugerir que a energia do flare solar e liberada em pequenos volumes e escalas de tempo 1.e. ocorre a fragmentacao de energia quando o fluxo emergente entra em contato com o campo magnetico existente

   83:   Uma implementacao de codigo em arvore para o calculo das forcas em problemas de muitos corpos e apresentada. A tecnica consiste essencialmente em virtualizar todo o sistema em uma estrutura de dados em arvore, o que torna o esforco computacional para o calculo das forcas da ordem de O(N log N) contra os O(N2) da soma direita. O integrador adotado e o simples "leap-frog" de segunda ordem de acuracia. Uma rapida discussao sobre os efeitos dos erros de truncamento sobre a morfologia do modelo e feita. Conclui-se que estes erros sao pequenos. Contudo, o processo de propagacao e markoviano se o passo de integracao se adapta aos potenciais, mantendo o erro esperando aproximadamente o mesmo por todo o sistema. Tambem e apresentado um breve estudo sobre efeitos dinamicos do comprimento de amolecimento, bem como os efeitos da estrutura da arvore sobre as forcas perturbativas, oriundas da natureza discreta da distribuicao. Os teste mostram que, mesmo para distribuicoes completamente arbitrarias, o codigo tem uma eficiencia as vezes melhor que O(N log N). A aplicacao do codigo e feita com o colapso de uma esfera homogenea fria, simulando um processo primordial de formacao galatica. A evolucao da entropia do sistema sugere que um estado de quase-equilibrio foi atingido apos aproximadamente 2 10 9 anos. E mostrado que a configuracao final mantem uma boa semelhanca com as propriedes dinamica e morfologicas das mais conhecidas elipticas gigantes. Uma discussao e feita sobre a evolucao das principais variaveis dinamicas do sistema. Durante toda a simulacao, a energia total foi conservada dentro de 0,1

   83:   Um radiometro de frequencia variavel com resolucao em frequencia de 1 GHz e resolucao temporal de (0,6 - 16) segundos, operando em comprimento de onda milimetrica, foi desenvolvido em conjunto com uma antena de 13,7 metros de diametros. Aqui, este novo radiometro, os procedimentos de calibracao e observacao de regiao ativa sao descritos em detalhes. As observacoes de regiao ativa foram efetuadas utilizando-se o radiometro milimetrico. Ate agora, os aspectros de quatro regioes ativas foram observados. Dois destes espectros exibiram estruturas finais em frequencia, tanto em emissao qto em absorcao, da ordem de 2 GHz de largura e com amplitude 100  do valor de fluxo original, permanecendo por cerca de meia hora. Os espectros do 'centro' do sol e aqueles de regioes ativas foram interpretados em termos de "bremsstrahlung" como um processo de emissao. A estrutura fina em absocao foi interpretada em termos da presenca de uma" lamina de corrente neutra" entre a radiofonte e o observador. A estrutura fina em emissao superposta foi discutida em termos de dois possiveis mecanismo: 1) a emissao de linha de ciclotron e 2) o registro em radio de um misterioso plato de temperatura na cromosfera

   83:   Este estudo destina-se a estimar as discrepancias entre as medidas de evapotranspiracao obtidas de lisimetros  e as de amostras naturais na Fazenda Dimona, AM Brasil. Este experimento e parte integrante do projeto ABRACOS. Uma camara para medicao de umidade foi especialmente desenvolvida e testada neste experimento. O experimento foi dividido em duas series de medidas, sendo que a primeira investigou o comportamento dos lisimetros em funcao da fracao de solo nu. Pode observar que lisimetros com pouca vegetacao apresentam maior reducao em evapotranspiracao quando comparados com amostras naturais numa razao acima de 30
   83:  . A segunda parte do experimento mostra que a reducao tambem ocorre logo apos a preparacao do lisimetro; 3 a 4 dias para lisimetros com uma alta proporcao de solo nu e 5 a 6 dias para lisimetros com grande proporcao de vegetacao

   83:   O presente estudo consiste em uma estatistica de onze anos de trajetorias e anticiclogeneses para os anticiclones fracos e moderados (1979 a 1989) e de trinta e oito anos (1953 a 1990) para os anticiclones intensos (cuja pressao media da trajetoria foi maior ou igual a 1030 hPa), utilizando cartas sinoticas das 12 CUT. A area estudada foi regiao continental da America do Sul situada entre 15 S e 55 S. Constatou-se que a regiao anticiclogenetica de anticiclones fracos e moderados esta localizada no norte da Argentina e Sul do Paraguai, enquanto a dos anticiclones intensos se posicionou na Argentina Central. Os anticiclones fracos, mais frequentes no outono e primavera, seguem uma trajetoria orientada zonalmente; os anticiclones moderados ou intensos, mais frequentes no inverno, se propagam de sudoeste para nordeste. Notou-se tambem que durante episodios de El Nino ha uma reducao no numero de anticiclones intensos. E interessante notar que durante o mes de junho os anticiclones continentais sao mais frequentes do que os maritimos

   83:   Apresenta-se um estudo coordenado de um sistema de tempestades sobre a America do Sul. Os dados foram obtidos por um detector de campo eletrico a bordo de um balao estratosferico lancado de Cachoeira Paulista  (22o39'S, 47o09'W) em 13 de dezembro de 1989. Estes dados foram complementados por dados sinoticos, radiossondagem local, imagens no infravermelho do satelite GOES-7, radares meteorologicos convencionais e por um sistema de deteccao e localizacao de relampagos. A analise dos resultados mostrou que a tempestade consiste de celulas de tempestade de grande extensao e com topos muito altos. Nas bordas do sistema algumas nuvens de tempestade foram distribuidas ao longo de linhas. A partir dos dados obtidos a bordo do balao estimou-se que as cargas das celulas de tempestade tem intensidade de centenas de coulombs. Tambem nao se observou a existencia da camada de blindagem. Os dados da temperatura estratosferica mostraram pertubacoes associadas com a tempestade, que talvez sejam devidas a ondas de gravidade geradas pela tempestade. Os dados de relampagos obtidos no solo mostraram que a maioria das descargas de retorno vieram das bordas da tempestade e foram positivas. Estes resultados parecem indicar que a estrutura eletrica das nuvens de tempestade na America do Sul apresenta algumas peculiaridades. A importancia dessas peculiaridades no circuito eletrico atmosferico global ainda precisa ser investigada

   83:   The (30mb) stratospheric temperatures at the North Pole during the winter months (November-February) showed large QBO (Quasibiennial Oscillations) but of an intermittent nature, different for different months and matching in phase with the QBO of tropical zonal wind. When the QBO was minimized by moving averages over two sucessive (yearly winter) values and then further over three successive values, the resultant series showed clear solar cycle variations with lags or leads of  (0-2) yr for temperature maxima with respect to sunspot maxima. However, in solar cycle 21 from 1978 onwards, temperatures seem to be more depressed, indicating enhanced stratosferic cooling in recent years, probably due to increase of greenhouse gases. No relationship with El Nino events is indicated

   83:   For solar cycle 19 (1954-1964), the 12 monthly mean values of noon-time foF2 at Ahmedabad (23 degrees N, 73 degrees E) show a large hysteresis effect when plotted against sunspot number or against geomagnetic Ap. However, a multiple regression analysis for the dependence of foF2 on solar 2800 MHz flux and geomagnetic Ap simultaneously, shows a better matching. Thus, long-term predictions need to take into account not just sunspot number but some solar index and geomagnetic index as two key parameters, simultaneously

   83:  The rotational motion of a satellite with a magnetic stabilization system is discussed. The motion is described by a nonautonomous differential equation, with the magnetic moment of the satellite as a parameter. The global phase portrait of the problem is investigated in a wide range of magnetic-parameter values, using a numerical realization of the method of Poincare point maps. New periodic solutions of the problem are found, and an analysis is carried out of the evolution of the phase portrait and the bifurcation of periodic solutions with varying magnetic-parameter values. The values of the magnetic parameter that must be avoided in the design of the satellite magnetic stabilization system are discussed

   83:  A three-dimensional adaptive finite element strategy is presented to be applied in general 3-D finite element codes oriented towards brick elements. Two main issues are explored: (1) the data structure needed to adaptively refine a 3-D mesh; and (2) an adaptivity algorithm which significantly reduces the number of refinement cycles. It is shown that, using adaptive meshes, a significant error reduction is obtained and that, when using gradually refined meshes, the Jacobi conjugate gradient method gains multigrid efficiency

   83:  This paper presents a nutational damping concept based on high-speed spinning of a fluid-filled reservoir. This device works as an energy dissipator. The main advantage of this concept is the sensitivity to angular spacecraft velocity perturbations because of the gyroscopic-induced motion in the fluid, due to the wheel spin. A numerical imulation is presented and the results illustrate the performance of the device. It shows to be very sensitive for small angles in spite of the null spacecraft angular velocity. The damper can be applied in low-spin spacecraft, dual-spin and momentum wheel stabilized spacecraft

   83:  Two important aspects of the electrodynamics of the equatorial ionospheric F region will be discussed here are the thermospheric winds and the electric fields. The thermospheric winds are generated by horizontal pressure gradients in the atmosphere due to solar heating. The electric fields result from two main components: (1) the E region fields that are mapped to the F region through the highly conducting magnetic field lines and (2) the F region dynamo field. Besides these two regular contributions to the F region electric 'fields, there is a component of magnetospheric origin, that becomes very important during magnetically disturbed periods. A very important aspect that must also be considered is the feedback between the electrodynamics and the thermospheric winds. Although the ionized component is only a minor constituent (one part in 10 3 at 300 km), a collision ion-neutral, unlike a collision neutral-neutral, will not show a momentum transfer as linear momentum, parallel to the neutral velocity, U. When a moving neutral particle strikes an ionized particle at rest in the thermosphere, some of the momentum imparted is converted into motion of the particle about the magnetic field and yields a net deflection in the q(U x B) direction, where B is the magnetic field and q includes the sign of the particle charge. The ionized particles are trapped onto the magnetic field lines so, instead of being accelerated parallel to U, they can act as a steady drag on the neutral wind. In this work we will discuss the three aspects mentioned above, based on measurements, and review the recent theoretical and numerical studies on the subject

About 40 occurrences of those moving disturbances were observed from 299 nights of observations within the period of 10 August 1977 to 4 July 1984. Their equatorward velocity, Wavelength and period were observed to be 150-300 ms-1 100-250 km and 15 min-3 h, respectively. HF polarimeter records showed neither phase nor amplitude scintillations during the occurrence of those airglow perturbations which demonstrates that the perturbations are not associated to equatorial plasma depletions

The model is based on the Green function for the multilayered structure calculated in the Fourier domain. The fields radiated by the array are calculated through an asymptotic expression obtained by the application of the stationary phase method. Radiation characteristics such as the directivity function, the ripple and the crosspolarisation level are discussed for arrays excited in the TM01 mode

Along its trajectory the balloon passed over three thunderstorms, as identified by video on-board images. The data give an unique opportunity to study the stratospheric conductivity variations

   83:  Estimation algorithms are presented. for the consistent determination inflight of focal-plane distortion parameters and alignment parameters for attitude sensing instruments. The ambiguity in the specification of the parameter sets is demonstrated and a simple prescription is given for removing it for the case of polynomial representations of the focal-plane distortion. We develop estimation algorithms for both the case in which the instrument determines the distortion coefficients and the three-axis attitude (alignment to an external coordinate system) as well as for the case in which the instrument measurements are used to determine the distortion coefficients and the relative alignment from another fixed sensor

   83:  Low latitude ground based stratospheric ozone monitors, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, are scarce. The most recent Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 1991 report uses only two Southern Hemisphere low latitude stations, Huancayo and Samoa, for the determination of trends. In order to contribute to those and other studies several modern Brewer total ozone monitors have been installed in Brazil. Besides the Natal (6 S, 35 W.) Dobson station, in operation since 1974, and the Dobson station at Cachoeira Paulista (23 S, 45 W), Brewer spectrophotometer instruments were installed at Rio Branco (9.9 S, 67.5 W) Cuiab† (16 S 56 W), and Santa Maria (29 S, 53.5 W). In addition, one Brewer system was installed in Punta Arenas, Chile (52.7 S, 71 W). Besides ozone, the most complete Brewers also produce column N02, S02, and UV-B data. All systems are producing data, except Rio Branco where a lightning discharge disabled the
instrument. In Punta Arenas the ozone hole of 1992 was observed. In addition to the 6 fixed ground stations, one automatic mobile ozonesonde station has produced
ozone profiles from the Brazilian Antarctic station Ferraz (62.1 S, 58.4 W), which also observed the 1992 ozone hole phenomenum

   83:  O gr†ben de Sete Barras localiza-se no vale do Rio Ribeira do Iguape, no litoral sul do Estado de S∆o Paulo. Trata-se de uma depress∆o tectìnica alongada na direá∆o NSOE, com cerca de 19 km de extens∆o e'5 km de largura. A partir de sondagens elÇtricas verticais (SEV), Melo et al. (1989) estimaram a espessura m†xima do preenchimento sedimentar entre 130 e 200 in, com um espessamento dos sedimentos da extremidade nordeste em direá∆o ao centro da estrutura. Sugeriram, ent∆o, que a depress∆o constitu° um gr†ben assimÇtrico, com o bloco abatido basculado para sudoeste. Os mesmos autores interpretaram ainda que o gr†ben seja preenchido por alternÉncias de camadas de espessura mÇtrica de ortoconglornerados, areias, dep¢sitos de corridas de lamas e de detritos, alÇm de sedimentos silto-argilosos concentrados no interior da depress∆o. Delgadas coberturas de cascalhos (Formaá∆o Eldorado) e aluvi‰es quatern†rios ocorrem tambÇm na †rea do gr†ben. Com o intuito de fornecer novas informaá‰es sobre o arcabouáo tectìnico do gr†ben e verificar sua poss°vel correlaá∆o com os processos geol¢gicos regionais que determinaram a evoluá∆o tectìnica da regi∆o, foram realizadas, em duas direá‰es fixas para a expans∆o dos eletrodos, NE (longitudinal) e NW (perpendicular ao eixo principal da estrutura), e no intervalo de freqÅàncias de 1,4 a 4500 Hz, 12 sondagens audiomagnetotel£ricas (AMT);ao longo de um perfil cortando transversalmente o eixo principal do gr†ben

In a first phase of the project, a graphical environment was developed to simplify and generalize the interactive programming concept. The resulting interface library gives the programmer easy access to graphical user interface tools such as indows, menus and dialogs. In order to improve programmer efficiency, the same interface library is being implemented to run under various existing toolboxes such as Macintosh, MS-Windows, OSF/Motif and others. During the second phase of the project, an innovative finite element data structure is developed which will be used as a finite element research platform

   83:  The Orbit Determination Extended to Maneuvers (ODEM) orbit determination system that is especially suited for orbit determination in the early operations phase (LEOP) of geostationary satellites has recently been developed at the German Space Operations Center (GSOC). The software comprises a precise modeling of thrust phases and allows utilization of 3-way Doppler data essential for an improved orbit determination accuracy based on short tracking data arcs. The modeling adopted includes conventional force models together with a realistic model of extended thrust phases. The thrust profile is composed of transition and steady-state phases and is applied to the sequence of apogee boost maneuvers performed in the course of the positioning phase of geostationary satellites using 400 N class thrusters. Two different thrust direction models allow either a purely inertial direction modeling or a model based on pitch and declination coefficients. Supported tracking data types include angles, 2-way range, 2-way range-rate and, additionally, 3-way range-rate. Up to 18 estimated state vector components are accepted, comprising the satellite state vector, drag coefficient, radiation pressure coefficient, and the thrust parameters. Estimation is performed using an extended Kalman filter with UD algorithm. Two applications of the ODEM software are analyzed: orbit determination in the early geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with short tracking data arcs; monitoring and calibration of an apogee boost maneuver

In this, paper the problem of spacecraft orbit transfer with minimum fuel, consumption is considered, in terms of selecting, implementing and testing numerical solutions. The main goal is to obtain the control laws for the maneuvers required by the Brazilian Remote Sensing Satellite. After a search in the literature and analysis of the results available, one selects two schemes of solution to the problem. In the first one the associated optimal control, problem is numerically treated by using a direct: search approach together with suboptimal parameterized control. In the second one, a hybrid approach is used where the determination of the initial values of the Lagrange multipliers (to solve the equations given by the first order necessary conditions for a local minimum transformed in a direct search problem. In both schemes numerical solution of the problem in each iteration is reduced to one of nonlinear programming, which is then solved with: gradient projection method. The spacecraft is supposed to be in  Keplerian motion controlled by the thrusts, that are assumed to be of fixed magnitude (either low or high) and operating in an on-off mode. Results of simulations are also presented

The TMTC runs along a distributed architecture comprising microcomputers plus a Data Base server inter-connected via LAN under TCP/IP protocol. This in-house developed software was designed according to the Object Modelling Technique (OMT). TMTC's software components represent clusters of classes related to functionality and building blocks of generic services. In order to establish a systematic way for the testing activities we have adapted the Hierarchical Approach (HA), proposed by Shel Siegel, to the experience and culture of the team. The HA, focusing on object-oriented testing, has fitted well with the aim of detecting as many faults as possible in the early phases of the development. In the HA almost all classes are individually tested before being gradually integrated into groups. Groups of classes are defined according to the scenarios specified in the system design phase. This has considerably reduced the testing effort. This paper also discusses the system class number in comparison with the number of stubs and drivers generated for testing. The difficulties to test a distributed application for satellite controlling and monitoring are likewise

The strategy for test generation combines different specification-based test methods: (i) transition testing for the control part of a protocol and (ii) syntax and equivalence partitioning for the data part. The tool uses a representation of the protocol in PSL (Protocol Specification Language), which is transformed into a format readable by a Prolog program. This implements the test strategies mentioned above. The text also presents some results obtained in the test generation for the protocol of the Tele-command Communication System of the SACI-1 satellite

   83:  For non-conservative mechanical systems (non-potential operators), classical energetic variational principles do not hold true. In the present paper, a generalized variational principle, valid for non-linear and non-conservative systems, is deduced by means of "potentializable" operators. A systematic inclusion of boundary conditions in problems dealing with such operators is proposed and examples from continuum mechanics are presented

   83:  Resulting from a cooperation program between the German Space Operations Center (GSOC) of the German Aerospace Research Establishment and the Brazilian Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas (INPE) a new general orbit determination system has recently been developed. Although the software supports orbit determination for all types of Earth satellite orbits it is especially suited to orbit determination in the course of the positioning phase of geostationary satellites. The features of the ODEM (Orbit Determination including Extended Maneuvers) software comprise the precise modeling of extended thrust phases and utilization of 3-way Doppler data which is essential for an improved orbit determination accuracy based on short tracking data arcs. The mathematical algorithms implemented to model the extended spacecraft thrust phases for different types of satellites are presented together with a brief overall software description. Extended thrust phase monitoring and estimation is particularly interesting for two main fields of application, which are analyzed using data from a recently performed positioning: Rapid diagnosis of the apogee boost maneuvers and calibration of station acquisition maneuvers. Results are presented for the achieved level of the final residuals as well as for the comparison of the estimated thrust values obtained from ODEM and conventional methods. The benefit, resulting from the processing of 3-way Doppler data, is discussed

   83:  We examine possible interplanetary mechanisms for the creation of the largest magnetic storms at the Earth. We consider the effects of interplanetary shock events on magnetic cloud and sheath plasma. We also examine the effects of a combination of a long-duration southward sheath magnetic field, followed by a magnetic cloud B-S event. Examination of profiles of the most intense storms from 1957 to the present indicate that the latter (double IMF B-Z events) is an important cause of superintense D-ST events.

Deep ozone holes were observed on several occasions. in addition, a Brewer spectrophotometer was installed in Punta Arenas in collaboration with the University of Magallanes. The results show minimum ozone of 190 DU on October 5, but the lowest monthly average at Punta Arenas was 306.1 DU in September

   83:   A explosao de 4 de novembro de 1981, as 1828 TU, foi simultaneamente em oito frequencias de microondas (1,4 - 44 GHz) pelos observatorios de Sagamore Hill (AFGL), Algonquin (HIA) e Itapetinga (INPE), bem como em sete canais de energia em raios-X duros, pelo experimento a bordo do satelite Hinotori (28-375). Os radio-espectros obtidos pelo observatorio de Sagamore Hill (1,4 - 15,4 GHz) foram processados com boa resolucao tempoeral (1 espectro/seg.). Os dados dos observatorios de Alngonquin (10,6 GHz) e Itapetinga (22 e 44 GHz) sao de alta sensibilidade e resolucao temporal (limitada neste estudo em 30 ms). Os perfis temporais em raios-x sao analisados no canal de mais baixa energia (28-38 Kev), com uma resolucao temporal de 30 ms. Alem disso, foram obtidos espectros em raios-x a cada 5-10 s, ao longo da fase principal da explosao. Por ser este um caso com diagnostico excepcionalmente completo, ele foi analizado com o objetivo de investigar os agentes responsaveis pelas variacoes espectrais e temporais observadas. Verificou-se que a suposicao comumente adotada de uma fonte de emissao homogenea com uma unica populacao de eletrons acelerados nao e consistente com as informacoes obtidas nas varias frequencias. Estas informacoes indicam que a emissao deve ser originada por mais de uma populacao de eletrons acelerados, em fontes mais complexas do que as usualmente consideradas. Os resultados mostram que, para a determinacao univoca dos componentes de emissao, sao necessarios diagnosticos mais completos ate agora nao disponiveis, particularmente sobre processos dinamicos espaciais, que devem ocorrer simultaneamente

   83:   Os sinais na faixa de VHF transmitidos por radio farois a bordo dos satelites geoestacionarios (GOES 1-3), recebidos em Cachoeira Paulisra durante os anos de 1982,1986 e 1989, sao analizados com o objetivo de investigar as variacoes do conteudo eletronico total ionosferico (CET) num ciclo solar. Um novo metodo de calibracao foi desenvolvido para converter as variacoes do angulo de rotacao Faraday, registradas pelo polarimetro VHF, em valores absolutos do CET. O metodo e capaz de remover uma incerteza de n, que geralmente esta presente nos dados do angulo de rotacao, registrados pelo polarimetro, e principalmente quando ocorre interrupcoes do angulo de rotacao, devido a eventos intensos de cintilacao (Spread F) ou outros casos. Nesta dissertacao, os valores do CET obtidos depois da calibracao, sao analizados para estudar as variacoes diurnas do CET com relacao a sazonalidade e atividade solar. O CET apresenta uma variacao semi-anual, com um valor maximo nos equinocios, quando comparado com os valores de inverno e verao. O efeito da anomalia equatorial que provoca um pico no CET, proximo da meia-noite sobre Cachoeira Paulista, desaparece nos meses de inverno de atividade solar maxima e praticamente nao existe em todos os meses de atividade solar minima. Os valores medidos do CET, sao tambem comparados com aqueles calculados pelo modelo IRI-90 para Cachoeira Paulista. Algunas discordancias entre os dados do modelo e dados observados sao encontradas principalmente em torno das 16:00 horas durante os anos de atividade solar maxima e minima. Alem disso, o IRI-90 nao preve o pico proximo da meia-noite no CET, causado pelo efeito da anomalia equatorial

   83:   Numerical experiments using a former operational JMA limited-area model, namely the 12l - FLM, were conducted to assess the model's perfomence in forecasting precipitation for tropical regions. Kuo's cumulus convenction parameterization was found to be superior to the moist adjustment scheme when used in a series of experiments for one selected region in the Tropical Pacific. Equivalent black body temperature maps were used to verify the forecasts. In addition, the model was also tested regarding its sensitivity to changes in the "moistenig parameter" b. The results show a dependence on the critical value of the relative humidity (RHC) in the Anthes'1977 formulation of the b parameter. Based on visual examinations of the TBB maps, values of RHC and the exponent n were selected for the 12L - FLM, but it seems likely that new "tuning-up" will be required if the model is to be used in other regions with different land-sea distributions

   83:   O presente trabalho propoe a formulacao e aplicacao de uma metodologia para determinar a temperatura de estrelas centrais de nebulosas planetarias. Esta metodologia consiste no uso de indices espectroscopicos globais para comparar objetos com modelos. Os dados espectroscopicos foram tomados da literatura, enquanto que os modelos foram calculados com o programa CLOUDY. Foram desenvolvidos tres metodos: o metodo I, compara a razao de linhas do Helio com as do Hidrogenio; o metodo S-N 1/2 e uma modificacao do metodo de balanceamento de energia, levando em conta classes de metalicidade e densidade do gas; o metodo TIN compara diretamente os indices espectroscopicos dos objetos com os dos modelos, minimizando as diferencas entre eles. Neste metodo as abundancias dos principais elementos quimicos sao calculadas. O metodo I, foi aplicado a 78 objetos; utilizamos o metodo S-N 1/2 para determinar a temperatura de 85 nebulosas, enquanto que o metodo TIN foi aplicado a 8 objetos. Os resultados sao discutidos e comparados com outras determinacoes publicadas na literatura. Uma das principais conclusoes do trabalho e de que apenas ~50
   83:   das nebulosas planetarias sao opticamente espessas. Finalmente, sugerimos alguns desenvolvimentos e aplicacoes futuros

   83:  Bulk stomatal conductances of Amazonian pasture, derived from micrometeorological measurements, are used to calibrate existing climate-based models of stomatal response. In the models, specific humidity deficit and solar radiation are the dominant controls on transpiration, with soil moisture providing the necessary seasonality. This paper relates hourly conductances to canopy-space climate to achieve parameters which are substantially independent of the aerodynamic characteristics of the measurement site, and a method is described for implementing this scheme within resistance-based models of surface fluxes for use in general circulation models. The results are compared with those from simpler methods using unmodified climate data measured at 3.5 m above the pasture. Although additional uncertainty is introduced by the estimation of canopy climate, reasonable accuracy is achieved in predicting evaporation at this site. It is demonstrated that errors may be introduced if the difference between measurement height for calibration and reference height for application is ignored

The CBERS is a remote sensing satellite that is under development by China and Brazil. This satellite is planned to stay in a polar frozen orbit and stationkeeping maneuvers will have to be performed to keep its orbital elements in a specified range. This report will be devoted to study the correction of the semi-major axis, eccentricity and argument of periapse, that are three of the Keplerian elements that will change due to the orbit perturbations

   83:  Thunderstorms with predominance of positive cloud-to-ground flashes have been identified to occur in the southeastern region of Brazil during the summer season. The thunderstorms are similar to those recently identified to occur in the Great Plains of the United States, although some differences are evident. The differences may be very important to elucidate their origin. Also, the observation seems to indicate that such thunderstorms may occur in several other regions of the world

   83:  We present the characteristics of the response of equatorial ionospheric zonal electric field and F-region plasma density to the asymmetric ring current intensifications that occurred in succession on 16 December 1991, corresponding to the STEP/EITS-2 campaign period. The study is based on high-time-resolution (1-min) data of asymmetic ring current indices, ASY(H/D) and F-region vertical plasma drift, Vz measurements at Kodaikanal (10.25ßN; 77.5ßE; dip 4ß), India and quarter-hourly ionosonde data of Fortaleza (4ßS; 322ßE; dip -9ß), Brazil. It is shown that short-lived disturbances in F-layer vertical plasma drift, K and height (h'F,/hpF2) indicative of westward and eastward electric fields prevail simultaneously in the dusk (18-21 LT) and predawn (02-05 LT) sectors, respectively, in association with the decay phase of asymmetic ring current events. Electric fields of opposite polarity do also seem to manifest at these local times, particularly in the early-morning sector in conjunction with the intensification of the asymmetric ring current. At a given location, electric field disturbances associated with individual asymmetric ring current events are thus bipolar in nature, with fields of opposite polarity during the growth and decay phases. The nature and polarity structure of the observed electric field disturbances are in agreement with the theoretical/model predictions of prompt penetration of high-latitude electric fields to the equatorial region

   83:  Three-hourly average values of the Dst, AE and ap geomagnetic activity indices have been studied for 1 year's duration near the solar minimum (1974) and also at the solar maximum (1979). In 1979 seven intense geomagnetic storms (Dst < -100 nT) occurred, whereas in 1974 only three were reported. This study reveals: (1) the yearly average of AE is greater in 1974 than in 1979, whereas the inverse seems to be true for the yearly average of Dst, when a higher number of intense storms is present. These averages indicate the kind of activity occurring on the sun as shown in earlier work. (2) The seasonal variation of Dst is higher than that of ap and is almost negligible in AE. (3) The correlation coefficient of ap x AE is in general the highest, as the magnetometers that monitor both indices are close, and is surpassed only by the ap x Dst correlation during geomagnetic storms, when the influence of the ring current is dominant. The correlation of ap x Dst also shows a seasonal variability. (4) For the first time a study of correlation between ap and a linear combination of AE and Dst has also been made. We found higher correlation coefficients in this case as compared to those between ap x Dst and ap x AE

   83:  The effects of the production and loss mechanisms that affect the Boltzmann equations are considered by the inclusion of a reactive term. The necessary elements to develop a proper form for this term are revised and the curent trends analyzed. Although no accurate theoretical treatment of the problem is possible due to the many body nature of it, important relations can be derived which, besides being representative of the quantitative aspects of the matter, are illustrative of the qualitative features of the phenomenon. The overall procedure is detailed in this revision

Apos uma descricao inicial do meio ambiente sob acao do Sol, abordam-se varios temas como o estabelecimento da temperatura das camadas, a composicao atmosferica, e sua dinamica. Trata tambem da quimica de algumas emissoes luminosas naturais, alem do geomagnetismo terrestre e sua acao sobre a atmosfera. A presenáa de ions e eletrons livres na atmosfera superior introduz uma nova dimensao no equilibrio dinamico das particulas, o que se desenvolve em boa parte ate a descricao das correntes eletricas livres. Adotou-se um tratamento amplo para favorecer a aplicacao dos conceitos tambem a outras atmosferas planetarias. 0 trabalho "Introducao a Geofisica Espacial" e o resultado de muitas horas de aula dedicadas aos estudantes da area. Ha muitos anos ja uso este material como notas de aula, apostila, dos cursos de pos-graduacao no INPE e de graduacao na USP. Nossa literatura, em lingua portuguesa, ainda e muito carente de livros especializados no assunto. Espero que meu livro seja o marco inicial de varios outros que virao seguir

   83:  Satellite soundings are an important source of upper air data over South America, where radiossonde observations are scarce. Nevertheless, this sort of data has not been used either operationally or in research. In this work, TOVS temperature and humidity profiles obtained by processing raw radiances, provided by NESDIS, using the International TOVS Processing Package (ITPP), were assimilated in a simple diagnostic model in order to evaluate the impact of satellite data. The case study refers to the heavy rainfall event that hit the city of Sao Paulo as well as the Sao Paulo State coastal areas in March 19, 1991, and were undected by the Brazilian conventional prediction services and were underestimated by the ECMWF and NMC numerical weather predictions. The results show that TOVS data are important for detecting monitoring and characterizing rapidly evolving sub-synoptic scale events in continental mid-latitudes in South America

   83:  The problem of spacecraft orbit transfer with minimum fuel consumption is considered in terms of selecting, implementing, and testing numerical optimal and suboptimal solutions. After a search in the literature and analysis of results available, two schemes of solution to the problem were selected. In the first one, the associated optimal control problem is numerically treated by using a direct search approach together with suboptimal parameterized control. In the second one, a hybrid approach is used where the determination of the initial values of Lagrange multipliers (to solve the equations given by the maximum principle) is transformed in a direct search problem. In both schemes, the numerical solution of the problem in each iteration is reduced to one of nonlinear programming, which is then solved with the gradient projection method. The spacecraft is supposed to be in Keplerian motion controlled by the thrusters that are assumed to be of fixed magnitude (either low or high) and operating in an on-off mode. RESUMO: espacial com m°nimo consumo de combust°vel, em termos de seleá∆o, implementaá∆o e testes numÇricos das soluá‰es escolhidas. O principal objetivo Ç obter as leis de controle para as manobras necess†rias ao SatÇlite Brasileiro de Sensoriamento Remoto. Depois de uma pesquisa bibliogr†fica e an†lise dos trabalhos dispon°veis, foram selecionados dois mÇtodos de soluá∆o do problema. No primeiro, o problema de controle ¢timo associado Ç tratado numericamente atravÇs de um mÇtodo de busca direta combinado com controle, sub-¢timo parametrizado. No segundo, o mÇtodo h°brido Ç usado e a determinaá∆o dos valores iniciais dos multiplicadores de Lagrange (necess†rias na resoluá∆o das equaá‰es dadas pelas condiá‰es necess†rias de primeira ordem para um m°nimo local) Ç transformada num problema de busca direta. Nos dois mÇtodos, a soluá∆o numÇrica em cada iteraá∆o Ç reduzida a um problema de programaá∆o n∆o-linear, que Ç resolvida pelo mÇtodo da projeá∆o do gradiente. 0 ve°culo espacial Ç considerado em `movimento Kepleriano controlado apenas pelo empuxo, que Ç assumido de magnitude constante (alta ou baixa) e operando em modo liga-desliga. Resultados de simulaá‰es numÇricas s∆o apresentados

   83:  The modeling and parameter estimation of drift in inertial sensors is discussed. The model includes constant drift, ramp effects, white noise (short-term random drift), and random walk (long-term random drift). The estimation is based on two different procedures. The first is achieved by a recursive formulation of the least squares method, which estimates the stochastic parameters. The second employs the usual formulation of the least squares method for the estimation of deterministic parameters. Digital simulation provides the validation of the proposed method. The algorithm can also be used with test data

   83:  It is well known that equatorial electrojet (EEJ) currents can significantly affect the geomagnetic variations. However, in a recent study (Padilha et al, 1997) it was observed that magnetotelluric (MT) soundings carried out across the dip equator in the Brazilian equatorial zone were not affected significantly due to EEJ currents. By using new results from geomagnetic variation signals, measured simultaneously to the MT experiment at a chain of equatorial and mid-latitude stations, an attempt is made here to explain the MT results in terms of the behaviour of the primary inducing field during the survey. Most of the analysis is performed by considering a single frequency (0.885 mHz), representative of the MT frequency interval. It is observed that the amplitude of the geomagnetic variations appears horizontally homogeneous within the study area (from -3 degrees to +3 degrees of geomagnetic latitude), indicating that the primary field in the analysed frequency range may be considered sufficiently uniform in the horizontal direction thus satisfying the Tikhonov-Cagniard plane-wave criterion. The same geomagnetic data also show that, if any EEJ source effect exists, it would be restricted to the transition zone (between 3 degrees and 5 degrees, at both sides of the dip equator). Dmitriev-Berdichevsky's constraints calculated at two different frequencies and a modelling exercise using EEJ parameters derived from a magnetometer array were able to explain the MT observations and have shown that source effects would just appear in frequencies lower than 1 mHz (resistive regions) and 0.1 mHz (conductive regions). Considering the characteristics of propagation and amplification of geomagnetic variations at the equatorial zone it is concluded that EEJ currents could be used as a source for lithospheric MT studies in these regions

   83:   No presente trabalho analisa-se o problema da ablacao unidimensional em meios compostos por multiplas camadas. E empregada uma tecnica de elementos finitos que usa uma formulacao Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SU/PG) com uma malha movel que se adapta a posicao da fronteira movel em cada instante de tempo. A formulacao SU/PG e usada para evitar as ocilacoes causadas por derivadas de primeira ordem na equacao de energia. Sao resolvidos problemas de ablacao com fluxos de calor que dependem do tempo e um exemplo tipico  de aplicacao aeroespacial de protecoes termicas. Sao feitas comparacoes com resultados de diferencas finitas recentemente obtidos atraves de uma tecnica de volumes de controle com diferenciacao exponencial. A tecnica da transformada integral generalizada (TTIG) e usada como uma solucao alternativa para o problema da ablacao em meios de multiplas camadas e para valiar os resultados obtidos pelo metodo de elementos finitos. Os autovalores necessarios para a solucao via TTIG sao determinados simultaneamente com as temperaturas transformadas pela redefinicao das equacoes transcendentais associadas em equacoes diferenciais ordinarias

Considering non-coplanar orbits, it's particularly important to minimize the fuel expenditure necessary for a specific plane change, since this kind of' maneuver is the main Fuel consumer. The method developed and presented here allows the choice of the orbital regions where the impulses can be applied. So, the contribution of' this paper is to develop, implement and test a new set of equations to solve the problem of' the minimum fuel bi-impulsive maneuver where it's possible to include constraints considerations, such as impulses positions restrictions, e.g., maneuvers been performed only in visible regions from a given groundstation

   83:  Neste trabalho foi desenvolvido uma nova versao do Filtro de Deteccao e Identificacao de Falhas. Esta nova versao possibilita a identificacao mais facil e segura de falhas em sensores podendo mesmo com um filtro, identificar falhas em qualquer um dos sensores. Testes foram realizados ilustrando o desempenho do filtro e a maneira de ajustar seus parametros. Os resultados dos testes demonstraram a potencialidade deste procedimento que pode ser util para se fazer a identificacao de falhas em sistemas dinamicos lineares invariantes no tempo

   83:   Neste trabalho sao descritos os resultados de um estudo das ceramicas Ce-TZP, preparadas a partir de misturas convencionais dos pos de ZrO2 e de CeO2 (na faixa de composicao de 8 a 16
   83:   molar de CeO2). Foram inter-relacionados as caracteristicas fisicas e quimicas dos pos com o comportamento de compactacao a verde e com o grau de sinterizacao das ceramicas. As ceramicas sinterizadas apresentaram uma porosidade relativamente alta (=4
   83:  ), devido as caracteristicas do po e da compactacao nao serem muito adequadas. As fases presentes foram analisadas por difracao de raios-X e mostraram que estas ceramicas podem sofrer transformacoes tetragonal-monoclinica induzida por tensao externa aplicada. Os valores de resistencia a flexao em 4 pontos, tenacidade a fratura por micropenetracao Vickers e dureza superficial Vickes mostraram uma dependencia com o teor de CeO2, com a microestrutura e com a temperatura de sinterizacao. As ceramicas Ce-TZP apresentaram valores de resistencia mecanica comparaveis aos publicados na literatura internacional

   83:   Neste trabalho foram preparados e caracterizados ressoadores dieletricos de ceramica de Ba2Ti9020 para aplicacoes em microondas como osciladores e filtros, utilizando materias-primas disponiveis no mercado brasileiro. Foi preparado uma mistura dos pos com a composicao molar de 0,182BaCO3.0,818TiO2, que foi compactada em forma de cilindros por presagem uniaxial e isostatica. Os compactados foram submetidos a sintetizacao da fase Ba2Ti9020 e a sinterizacao da ceramica em 1300oC, ao ar. As ceramicas sinterizadas foram caracterizadas quanto as fases e aos elementos quimicos presentes. Foram medidos a densidade e alguns parametros de interesse em microondas, como a constante dieletrica, o fator de qualidade devido as perdas dieletricas e a frequencia de ressonancia. Os resultados foram comparados com aqueles obtidos para um ressoador dieletrico de Ba2Ti9020 comercial fabricado pela Trans-Tech (EUA), mostrando-se bem proximos

A estrutura externa da cavidade compreende um guia de ondas fracamente irregular enquanto o condutor interno consiste em um cilindro homogeneo. Sequencias de modos fundamentais TE sao identificadas sobre o intervalo de 9 a 17 GHz atraves de medidas das frequencias ressoantes e dos fatores de qualidade associados aos varios modos. Verifica-se que o numero de modos normais em uma dada sequencia depende da geometria do cilindro central considerado

   83:   Neste trabalho e apresentado uma metodologia para otimizacao de estruturas que podem ser modeladas como cascas axissimetricas. Pode-se considerar a minimizacao de dois tipos de funcao objetivo: a massa da estrutura ou uma relacao da massa sobre o momento de inercia em relacao ao eixo de simetria. E possivel tratar problemas com restricoes sobre autovalores dos modos de vibracao, deslocamento nodais, tensoes distribuidas ao longo da estrutura e sobre propriedades de inercia. A analise estrutural utiliza o Metodo dos Elementos Finitos para a discretizacao, sendo empregado um elemento axissimetrico de casca de tres nos. As variaveis de projeto sao definidas como as espessuras da casca nos nos desses elementos, caracterizando o problema de otimizacao estrutural como de dimensionamento (malha fixa). A analise de sensibilidade da funcao objetivo e das restricoes a variacoes nas espessuras e feita pelo metodo analitico direto. O problema de programacao nao linear que fica estabelecido e resolvido usando o metodo modificado das direcoes viaveis. Como exemplos de aplicacoes apresentamos os resultados obtidos para quatro configuracoes propostas de volantes para o atuador de sistema de controle de atitude do tipo roda de reacao

   83:  In this letter, we have investigated the effect of energetic electron precipitation at the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly on the local mesospheric ozone concentration. In the mesosphere, the ionization produced by precipitation acts as a source of odd hydrogen. Since odd hydrogen processes dominate ozone destruction in this region, a decrease in the ozone concentration should be expected during these events. Based on a simple photochemical equilibrium model, it is estimated that at large solar zenith angles the ozone concentration between about 70 and 80 km altitude in the anomaly region can be considerably depleted, mainly during large geomagnetic storms

   83:   Apresenta-se a descricao completa de um Sistema de Visao Computacional aplicado as atividades de inspecao, detalhando-se todas as fases do ciclo de vida deste sistema. Ele foi concebido, projetado e implementado no contexto de uma pesquisa aplicada, cujo titulo e : (VISART) - Visao Artificial para Uso Industrial: Um sistema Abrangente. Durante o esforco utilizado no desenvolvimento deste trabalho contribuicoes foram incorporadas ao estado da arte em processamento de imagens binarias. O sistema VISART inclui recursos, conceitos e inovacoes nao observadas em Sistemas similares. Uma nova terminologia com termos tecnicos mais proximos daqueles utilizados por engenheiros e tecnicos, em ambientes industriais, e proposta e deve contribuir para a aceitacao e disseminacao de Sistemas de Visao nesses ambientes. Conceitos de Tecnologia de Grupo foram associados a Sistemas de Visao e devem contribuir para uma maior integracao da automacao de processos industriais. Uma estrutura de dados especial foi concebida para armazenamento de dados de imagens, permitindo reduzir, substancialmente, o tempo de processamento de algoritmos de extracao de caracteristicas de partes industriais. Uma biblioteca com um numero consideravel de algoritmos de extracao de caracteristicas, utilizadas para o reconhecimento, aceitacao ou rejeicao de produtos industriais sob inspecao, foi concebida e implementada. Novos algoritmos podem ser adicionados a esta biblioteca, pelo proprio usuario, sem a necessidade de reprogramacao de modulos do Sistema VISART. Neste aspecto, reside um dos principais fatores de abrangencia do VISART. Ele possui um editor grafico que possibilita seu uso em atividades de ensino e de formacao de pessoal, na area de visao. Em principio, este recurso dispensa a utilizacao de sensores, tornando-o mais economico para uso nestas atividades. Enfim, este trabalho de pesquisa e pioneiro no Brasil, e sua divulgacao devera contribuir, significativamente, para a disserminacao e o crescimento da area de Visao Computacional aplicada a inspecao, no pais

   83:   The problem of determining the optimal board length from which panels have to be cut to satisfy some specified demand with minimun waste is analysed. Two heuristic procedures are suggested. The first procedure uses binpacking heuristics successively; the second method uses a branching scheme where potentially good board lengths are analysed

   83:   The diffusion of cold plasma through multidipole fields of a magnetic picket fence is presented. The ion diffusion and trapping is determined by electric potentials inside the multidipole fields. The electron diffusion is regulated by an anomalous transport process driven by low frequency fluctuations inside the magnetic sheath. Particles drifting with velocities above the ion acoustic speed generates high amplitude turbulent waves responsible for an anomalous diffusion process

   83:   The problem of determining the optimal length of a board with fixed width from wich panels have to be cut to satisfy some specified demand with minimum waste is analysed. The proposed procedure generates a lower bound on the best solution that can be obtained for each one of the board length values within the allowed range. This lower bound contour is updated each time after a potentially good board length is analysed. The search stops when the solution is within a pre-specified error. This new algorithm is much better than a previously suggested method by Yanasse, Zinober and Harris to solve the same problem

   83:   An enumeration sheme to find the K-best solutions to the value independent Knapsack problem is presented. The scheme requires O(N(B-A(1))) of memory allocation where A(1), without loss of generality, is the smallest coefficient of the Knapsack constraint. Memory requirements may be reduced to O(B-A(1)) with a slight deterioration in computational performance when retrieving the K-best solutions. Similar schemes are presented for the 0-1 case and when the variables have explicit upper bounds. Keywords: Knapsack, subset sum, linear diophantine equation, enumeration scheme

   83:  A forest inventory was carried out exclusively to obtain an estimate of aboveground biomass for Amazonian dense tropical moist forests, particulary in the South of Para and South of Roraima. These regions have suffered very high deforestation rates in the last five years. Aboveground biomass was estimated through mathematical model for total (stem and crown) fresh and dry weight of all vegetatin with a diameter at breast heigth (dbh) greater than 5 cm. The selected models contained tree dbh and total height. Besides biomass this paper also presents estimates for number of trees (N) and basal area (BA) on a hectare (ha) basis. Sampling size was 22.8 ha, and plot demensions were 20 by 200 m for both regions. Dry weigth estimates for South of Para and South of Roraima are 185 t/ha and 228 t/ha

   83:    The effect of latent heat of condensation on baroclinic instability process is studied using the model developed by Bonatti and Rao. This model includes the effect of latent heat of condensation as parameterized by Mak, a zonal wind profile that varies linearly with pressure, and a constant lapse rate of-6 degrees C Km-1. The effect of dissipative terms and vertical variation of heating on baroclinic instability with positive and negative zonal wind shears is studied. Dissipative terms and the type and intensity of heating change the selecton of the most unstable wave. Viscosity and Newtonian cooling stabilize short waves. The characteristics of the most unstable wave obtained using a double maximum in the vertical distribution of heating and observed vertical profiles of zonal wind and temperature representative of the summer monsoon of India resemble those of observed monsoon depressions.The inclusion of dissipative effects makes the Green mode the most unstable wave

   83:  This paper has the goal of developing an analytical and a numerical study of the perturbation caused in a spacecraft by a third body involved in the dynamics. One of the important applications of the present research is to calculate the effect of Lunar and solar perturbations on high-altitude Earth satellites. There is a special interest to see under which conditions a near-circular orbit remains near circular. The so called "critical angle of the third-body perturbation," that is a value for the inclination such that any near-circular orbit with inclination below this value remains near-circular, is discussed in detail. The assumptions of our model are very similar to the ones made in the restricted three-body problem: a) There are only three bodies involved in the system: a main body with mass m0 fixed in the origin of the reference system; a massless spacecraft in a generic orbit around the main body and a third body in a circular orbit around the main body in the plane x-y; b) The motion of the spacecraft is supposed to be a three dimensional Keplerian orbit with its orbital elements disturbed by the third body. The motion of the spacecraft is studied under two different models: i) A double-averaged analytical model with the disturbing function expanded in Legendre polynomials; ii)A full unaveraged three-body problem in three dimensions, without any truncation or approximation. The double-averaged models make the averages over the short period of the spacecraft and the long period of the distant third-body. Next, the theory developed here is used to study the behavior of a lunar satellite, where the Earth is the disturbing body. Several plots show the time-histories of the Keplerian elements of the orbits involved

   83:  Despite the performance potential of multicomputers, several factors have limited their widespread adoption. Of these, performance variability is among the most significant. Execution of some programs may yield only a small fraction of peak system performance, whereas others approach the system's theoretical performance peak. Moreover, the observed performance may change substantially as application program parameters vary. Data parallel languages, which facilitate the programming of multicomputers, increase the semantic distance between the program's source code and its observable performance, thus aggravating the performance problem. In this thesis, we propose a new methodology to predict the performance scalability of data parallel applications on multicomputers. Our technique represents the execution time of a program as a symbolic expression that is a function of the number of processors (P), problem size (N), and other system-dependent parameters. This methodology is based on information collected at compile time. By extending an exiting data parallel compiler (Fortran D95), we derive, during compilation, a symbolic model that represents the cost of each high-level program section and, inductively, of the complete program. These symbolic expressions may be simplified externally with current symbolic tools. Predicting performance of the program for a given pair (P,N) requires simply the evaluation of its corresponding cost expression. We validate our implementation by predicting scalability of a variety of loop nests, with distinct computation and communication patterns. To demonstrate the applicability of our technique, we present a series of concrete performance problems where it was successfully employed: prediction of total execution time, identification and tracking of bottlenecks, cross-system prediction, and evaluation of code transformations. These examples show that the technique would be useful both to users, in optimizing and tuning their programs, and to advanced compilers, which would have a means to evaluate the expected performance of a synthesized code. According to the results of our study, by integrating compilation, performance analysis and symbolic manipulation tools, it is possible to correctly predict, in an automated fashion, the major performance variations of a data parallel program written in a high-level language

The effects of pump depletion, dissipation and frequency mismatch in the nonlinear wave dynamics are analyzed. The relevance of this theory for understanding the fine structures of auroral whistler-mode emissions and amplitude modulations of auroral Langmuir waves is dicussed

   83:  Realizou-se um estudo do nivel medio do mar mensal, com a remocao de tendencias lineares e com filtragem, utilizando os dados obtidos em 22 portos oceanicos, no periodo de 1957-1986, no Oceano Atlantico Norte Extra-tropical (ANET). A metodologia adotada foi a de analise de Funcoes Ortogonais Empiricas (EOFs) e a de analise espectral (metodo de maxima entropia e da transformada rapida de Fourier utilizando a janela de Tukey). As tres primeiras EOFs analisadas totalizaram 58

Para dois portos "representativos" das bordas do ANET, Nova York (EUA) e Delfzijl (Holanda), no periodo de 1893-1988, e para as oscilacoes do NMM no ANET, adotou-se a mesma metodologia, objetivando maior definicao espectral e determinacao da escala interdecadal. Os periodos de 57, 28, 19-17, 14, 6-5, 3 anos, 27 e 14-13 meses foram encontrados. Da comparacao com outros autores, as possiveis causas dessas oscilacoes, bem como resultados recentes de modelagem e outras variaveis climaticas que apresentam esses periodos de oscilacao sao indicados neste trabalho

   83:  This paper reviews the climatological measurements and some of the modeling in the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observational Study (ABRACOS) project. The local-scale, mesoscale, and large-scale climatic impacts of Amazonian deforestation are demonstrated. The difference in radiation and energy balance between forest and clearing gives higher air temperatures in the clearings, particularly in the dry season. In areas of substantial deforestation, higher sensible heat fluxes from the cleared forest produce deeper convective boundary layers, with differences in cloud cover being observed and mesoscale circulations being predicted. The use of the ABRACOS data for calibrating general circulation model land surface schemes is discussed

   83:  Nighttime atomic hydrogen and ozone concentrations are derived from simultaneous measurements of the vertical profiles of upper mesospheric airglow emissions and atmospheric sodium. The airglow profiles were obtained in a sounding rocket experiment launched from Alcantara (2.5 degrees S, 44.2 degrees W) on May 31, 1992. A lidar operating at the launch site was used to measure sodium at the time of the rocket experiment. A total of 10 airglow photometers, 6 forward looking and 4 side looking, observed the OI 557.7 nm, O2 Herzberg and O2 atmospheric (0,0) bands, sodium D lines, OI 630 nm, OH(8,3) band, and the airglow continuum. The simultaneous ground-based sodium lidar and onboard sodium airglow measurements made it possible to derive the ozone concentration at heights between 85 and 100 km. The hydrogen concentrations were then calculated from the O2 atmospheric (0,0), OH(8,3), and the ozone profiles. The results suggest that the hydrogen concentration varied from 1 x 10 9 cm-3 at 100 km, values much higher than those suggested by recent model atmospheres and by some rocket observations at middle and high latitudes. Although the method of obtaining the concentrations of the minor constituents in the upper atmosphere is an indirect optical technique, this is the first time that these concentrations have been measured by rocket in the equatorial region

   83:    Principal modes of anomalous upper-tropospheric circulation and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are determined for the South Amerian sector. A combined EOF analysis is performed using anomalous 250-mb zonal and meridional wind components plus anomalous OLR. The data are filtered so that modes on both intraseasonal and interannual timescales can be studied separately. The resulting patterns show a consistent relationship between anomalous OLR and anomalous upper-tropospheric circulation features. The first and second interannual modes contain many atmospheric features related to extremes in the Southern Oscillation. These include 1) variations in the pattern of tropical convection, and 2) changes in the intensity of upper-troposferic zonal flow in the equatorial band and in the subtropics. The first intraseasonal mode has its greatest loadings in the Tropics and is most active during the southern summer season. For positive (negative) amplitudes of this mode, anomalous upper-tropospheric westerly (easterly) flow dominates the Tropics throughout the region, and positive (negative) OLR anomalies are observed over northeastern South America and over the eastern equatorial Pacific. These features are associated with the 30-60 day (Madden-Julian) oscilation. An extended combined EOF analysis was performed to study the evolution of intraseasonal oscillations in the South American sector. The first rotated combined extended EOF mode describes a sequence of patterns in wich anomalous equatorial westerlies and positive OLR anomalies over tropical Brazil gradually weaken and then reverse. The largest loadings throughout the evolution of the patterns contained in the first mode remain in the Tropics and subtropics. These results provide information on the combined relationship between atmospheric circulation and convection over the South American sector and on the evolution of patterns associated with 30-60 day (intraseasonal) oscillations. By projecting the combined fields of anomalous OLR and 250-mb zonal and meridional wind onto the individual patterns contained in the first rotated combined extended EOF mode, one obtains indices that should enhance real-time monitoring efforts and may lead to improved monthly forecasts for the South American sector

   83:  The tropical Atlantic Ocean is characterized by a large seasonal cycle around which there are climatically significant interannual and decadal timescale variations. The most pronounced of these interannual variations are equatorial warm events, somewhat similar to the El Nino events for the Pacific, and the so-called Atlantic sea surface temperature dipole. Both of these phenomena in turn may be related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability in the tropical Pacific and other modes of regional climatic variability in ways that are not yet fully understood. PIRATA (Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic) will address the lack of oceanic and atmospheric data in the tropical Atlantic, which limits our ability to make progress on these important climate issues. The PIRATA array consists of 12 moored Autonomous Temperature Line Acquisition System buoy sites to be occupied during the years 1997-2000 for monitoring the surface variables and upper-ocean thermal structure at key locations in the tropical Atlantic. Meteorological and oceanographical measurements are transmitted via satellite in real time and are available to all interested users in the research or operational communities. The total number of moorings is a compromise between the need to put out a large enough array for a long enough period of time to gain fundamentally new insights into coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions in the region, while at the same time ecognizing the practical constraints of resource limitations in terms of funding, ship time, and personnel. Seen as a pilot Global Ocean Observing System/Global Climate Observing System experiment, PIRATA contributes to monitoring the tropical Atlantic in real time and anticipates a comprehensive observing system that could be operational in the region for the 2000s

The experiment is part of a major effort to quantify the amounts of carbon dioxide generated by this Kind of clearing process. Following the procedure used by native people in the region, the trees were cut and the biomass left to dry on the ground for three months before burning. The fire burned through the whole one hectare area. The results include a carbon mass balance of the test site, air temperatures and heat transfer rates inside the ground. The carbon balance allowed the estimation of the carbon gasification efficency for this kind of fire

   83:   This paper describes recent developments in climate modeling at Meteo-France related to land surface processes. The implementation of a simple land surface parameterization, Interactions between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA), has gained from previous validations and calibrations at local scale against field datasets and from aggregation procedures devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements for climate purposes are introduced: spatial variability of convenctive rainfall in canopy drainage estimation and subsurface gravitational percolation. The methodology used to derive climatological maps of land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model from existing databases for soil and vegetation types at global scale is described. A 3-yr integration for the present day climate with a T42L30 version of the climate model has been performed. Results obtained compare favorably with available observed climatologies related to the various components of the continental surface energy and water budgets. Differences are due mostly to a poor simulation of the precipitation field. However, some differences suggest specific improvements in the surface scheme concerning representation of the bare soil albedo, the surface runoff, and the soil moistured initialization. As a first step prior to tropical deforestation experiments presented in Part II, regional analyses over the Amazon forest indicate that the modeled evaporation and net radiation are in good agreement with data collected during  the Amazon Region Micrometeorological Experiment campaign

   83:  Daily European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses for the 1980-1989 period are used to study cyclonic vortices at the upper tropospheric levels (CVULs) in the vicinity of northeast Brazil. The occurrence of CVULs shows significant interannual and seasonal variability, with the highest frequency found during the Southern Hemisphere summer months. CVULs develop mostly over oceanic areas, with the closed circulation at 200-hPa and the cold core at 300-hPa, and remain confined to the middle and upper troposphere. The CVUL mean lifetime ranges from 4 days in June to 11 days in February. Approximately 57  of the Southern Hemisphere summer CVULs originate accordingly to the formation mechanism so far known. In 27  of the Southern Hemisphere summer cases, the vortex originates associated with the occurrence of an upper level anticyclonic circulation over southwestern Atlantic and southeastern Brasil, in turn associated with stationary cold fronts (South Atlantic Convergence Zone-SACZ). CVULs can present regular or irregular trajectories. Midlatitude trough associated with frontal systems and an inter-hemispheric bifurcation of the upper level westerlies in the northwest of South America can cause such irregular displacements. For the CVULs with regular displacement, it is common to observe an amplification of the ridge axis in the southeastern sector of the Bolivian High, which can cause the upper level anticyclone in the southwestern Atl

   83:  Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into pastures or annual crops will likely lead to changes in the local microclimate of those regions. Larger diurnal fluctuations of surface temperature and humidity deficit, increased surface runoff during rainy periods and decreased runoff during the dry season, and decreased soil moistrue are to be expected. It is likely that evapotranspiration will be reduced because of less available radiative energy at the canopy level since grass presents a higher albedo than forests, also because of the reduced availability of soil moisture at the rooting zone primarily during the dry season. Recent results from general circulation model (GCM) simulations of Amazonian deforestation seem to suggest that the equilibrium climate for a grassy vegetation in Amazonia would be one in which regional precipitation would be significantly reduced. Global climate changes probably will occur if there is a marked change in rainfall patterns in tropical forest regions as a result of deforestation. Besides that, biomass burning of tropical forests is likely adding CO2 into the atmosphere, thus contributing to the enhanced greenhouse warming

   83:  Long-term hydroclimatological records in tropical South America have been analyzed in order to determine whether or not there have been significant changes in the hydrological cycle. Streamflow data from several rivers in Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, as well as rainfall in Northeast Brazil have been used here for the study of long-term and interannual variations on hydrological conditions in different regions of South America. The Mann-Kendall statistical test is applied to the historical streamflow annual series in order to detect trends or changes in the mean. The Student t-test is also applied to study the relationship between interannual variability and the magnitude of change and length of data required to identify a statistically significant trend. It follows from the statistical analysis of the currently available historical river data set that there is no clear evidence of trend or change in the mean streamflow of South American rivers resulting from a climate change, even though significant trends towards drier conditions have been found for rivers in the Northwest coast of Peru and in eastern Brazil. Interannual variations characterized the hydrology of tropical South America, in association with the extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation. The change required to identify a statistically significant variation in the mean is directly proportional to the interannual variability. The effects of Amazon deforestation are not noticeable on the 1903-92 interannual variability of the Rio Negro series at Manaus nor in rainfall time series

   83:  Measurements from the first comparative study of climate over Amazonian tropical forest and an embedded deforested clearing are presented. Observations comprise a continuous 60-day run of data from mid-October to mid-December 1990, covering the end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season. Mean hourly observations are calculated for the whole period; and for two 10-day periods, one in the dry season and one at the start of the wet season. Much greater variation in weather variables was observed at the clearing compared with over the forest. While the mean values of temperature and specific humidity deficit differed by less than 1-degrees-C and 1 g kg-1 respectively, their daily ranges at the clearing were twice those at the forest. Mean daily albedo of the forest was 13-1 per cent, agreeing well with other tropical forest measurements, and of the clearing was 16.3 per cent, somewhat lower than the values currently being used in GCMs. The surface energy balance was investigated and mean available energy calculated for each site. The significant difference in the daily pattern of net radiation between the sites was found to be at least as much due to differences in the longwave radiation balance as to differences in albedo. The diurnal pattern of net radiation therefore changed between dry and wet periods as the higher plant water stress experienced by clearing vegetation altered the daily temperature cycle

   83:  A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellite data is used to study drought evolution in the South American continent. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data are used to produce NDVI maps for the South American continent during the period from 1 August 1981 to 30 June 1987. A 15-day maximum-value composite procedure is used to partially eliminate cloud contamination and atmospheric attenuation. Vegetation response to drought is studied by inspection of the temporal and spatial evolutions of monthly drought area maps, which are delineated by NDVI values lower than 0.22: Drought area evolution patterns over the continent during the period of 1981-1987 for the months of May and September are discussed. The results show a well-defined regional dependence of the drought area variability. Drought dynamics analyses are performed for the dry year of 1982-1983 and for the wet year of 1984-1985. This information is used to discuss the relationship of the drought pattern with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Emphasis is given to the north-eastern region of Brazil, for which the relative drought area coverage was computed to demonstrate its high interannual drought variability. An intensification of this behaviour during the 1982-1983 ENSO event was identified in this area. The results indicate the potential use of satellite NDVI imagery to monitor drought occurrences as well as to study climatic variability on regional and continental scales

   83:  The total ozone column is well correlated with tropospheric fields such as the heights of the upper tropospheric geopotential surfaces and thus it can provide useful information on temporal variability in the troposphere. The global availability of long period satellite measurements of the total ozone column, taken by the TOMS instruments since 1978, provides a valuable and independent data set for use in studies of seasonal and interannual climate variability. In this study, the global low-frequency seasonal teleconnections in the observed TOMS data from 1979-91 have been investigated using seasonal teleconnectivity maps and empirical orthogonal function analysis. They have also been compared with the results from a simulation made with the atmospheric GCM at Meteo-France, having prescribed observed sea surface temperatures for the same period. In the observed total ozone, strong ENSO-related wave number one longitudinal dipole patterns are seen in both the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. The model shows much weaker variability in total ozone yet appears to be able to capture similar teleconnection patterns in the tropics related to ENSO. In the SH extratropics, the model total ozone shows a strong wave number 3 response rather than the wave number one dipole seen in the observations. A wave number 3 response is also evident in the 200 hPa geopotential height simulated by the model and in the NCEP analysis, and is consistent with the response in a linearised barotropic model forced in the Indonesian region. The different responses in the modelled and observed total ozone, suggest that tropopause effect is not the major factor in the SH extratropics, and it is likely that horizontal ozone transport also plays a role in this region.

   83:   Bulk stomatal conductances of Amazonian pasture, derived from micrometeorological measurements, are used to calibrate existing climated-based models of stomatal response. In the models, specific humidity deficit and solar radiation are the dominant controls on transpiration, with soil moisture providing the necessary seasonality. This paper relates hourly conductances to canopy-space climate to achieve parameters which are substantially independent of the aerodynamic characteristics of the measurement site, and a method is described for implementing this scheme within resistence-based models surface fluxes for use in general circulation models. The results are compared with those from simpler methods using unmodified climate data measured at 3.5 m above the pasture. Although additional uncertainty is introduced by the estimation of canopy climate, reasonable accuracy is achieved in predicting evaporation at this site. It is demonstrated that errors may be introduced the difference between measurement height for application is ignored

   83:  The interannual variability of deep convection over the South American sector and regional hydrometeorological anomalies are studied using International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data for 1984-1988. Satellite-derived convection anomalies are compared with regional rainfall and river runoff anomalies. At the height of the austral summer, the deep convective clouds (DCC) and ISCCP depict the centres of intense convection over central Amazonia and the mouth of the River Amazon, as well as the enhanced convection over north-east Brazil, which is related to the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Positive/negative regional hydrometeorological anomalies are consistent with positive/negative anomalies in the deep convection over northern Amazonia, the mouth of the River Amazon and north north-east Brazil, whereas this is not always true over southern Amazonia and southern Brazil. Over north-east Brazil and the mouth of the River Amazon, abundant rainfall and large DCC are both in agreement with variations in the latitudinal position and intensity of the Atlantic ITCZ, which extends between 4 degrees N and 5 degrees S along the Atlantic coast, where the precipitation maximum is found. The related rainfall anomalies over Amazonia and north-east Brazil during years with anomalously warm or cool surface waters in the central equatorial Pacific (e.g. the El Nino event in 1987), are consistent with the convection anomalies as depicted by the ISCCP deep convective clouds. For the Amazon Basin and north-east Brazil, DCC based on 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees horizontal resolution explained about 50 per cent of the variance of rainfall at individual surface stations. A new finding is the enhanced convective activity located at the east side of the central Andes and over central Amazonia around 5 degrees S, with a region of reduced convection in between. These two subcentres are oriented west-east and are part of the summertime semi-permanent centre of convection over the Amazon Basin, and have not been identified previously from the analysis of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) or highly reflective clouds. These subcentres of large DCC exhibit interannual variations in intensity and location, where the centre located near the east flank of the Andes shows a wider range of latitudinal variations than that located over central Amazonia. South of this area convection and rainfall decreases rapidly

   88:  Amazon basin.
   83:  Meteorological observations from the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study (ABRACOS), together with the global reanalysis from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and satellite images, have been used to study the spatial extent and intensity of cold surges (known locally as ''friagens'') in the Amazon basin. Case studies are presented of two of the strongest events of the 1994 winter season: 26 June and 10 July 1994. In both events, daily minimum temperatures in southeastern Brazil dropped to near or below 0 degrees C, while at the same time minimum temperatures in southern Amazonia (Ji-Parana site) were almost 8 degrees C below average. Air temperature and humidity also fell in central and western Amazonia (Manaus and Maraba sites, respectively), although the fact that these reductions were less substantial than those farther to the south indicates that the cold air is greatly modified as it moves across Amazonia. In Ji-Parana the largest drops in minimum temperature coincided with strong winds from the south, implying that cold advection was the main mechanism for the falling temperatures. In contrast, there was no increase in wind speed at Manaus and Maraba during the days with reduced temperatures. At these sites, cooling was due to a reduction of the maximum temperature caused, at least partially, by increased cloudiness rather than by a lowering of minimum temperatures as at Ji-Parana. With regard to the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), it is observed that during the passage of the cold air in southern Amazonia, the ABL was cooler and shallower than during the pre-and postfriagem days. The friagens presented are of 5- to 6-day duration, including the passage of the cold front, but the period with cold temperatures lasts between 2 and 3 days

   83:  Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into pastures or annual crops could lead to changes in the climate. We have used a coupled numerical model of the global atmosphere and biosphere (Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere GCM) to assess the effects of Amazonian deforestation on the regional and global climate. We found that when the Amazonian tropical forests were replaced by degraded grass (pasture) in the model, there was a significant increase in the mean surface temperature (about 2.5-degrees-C) and a decrease in the annual evapotranspiration (30 reduction), precipitation (25 reduction), and runoff (20 reduction) in the region. The differences between the two simulations were greatest during the dry season. The deforested case was associated with larger diurnal fluctuations of surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit; such effects have been observed in existing deforested areas in Amazonia. The calculated reduction in precipitation was larger than the calculated decrease in evapotranspiration, indicating a reduction in the regional moisture convergence. There was also an increase in the length of the dry season in the southern half of the Amazon Basin, which could have serious implications for the reestablishment of the tropical forests following massive deforestation since rainforests only occur where the dry season is very short or nonexistent. An empirical bioclimatic
scheme based on an integrated soil moisture stress index was used to derive the movement of the savanna-forest boundary in response to the simulated climate change produced by large-scale deforestation. The implications of possible climate changes in adjacent regions are discussed

   83:  A biosphere model based on BATS (Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme) is coupled to a primitive equation global statistical-dynamical model in order to study the climatic impact due to land surface alterations. The fraction of the earth's surface covered by each vegetation type according to HATS is obtained for each latitude belt. In the control experiment, the mean annual zonally averaged climate is well simulated when compared with observations. Deforestation and desertification experiments are performed. In the deforestation experiment, the evergreen broadleaf tree in the Amazonian region is substituted by short grass; in the desertification experiment the semidesert, and the tall grass and deciduous shrubs are substituted by desert and semidesert in the African continent, respectively. The results show that in both the experiments there is a reduction in evapotranspiration and precipitation in the perturbed region and an increase in the soil surface temperature, the temperature of the foliage air layer, and the foliage temperature. Also, the latent heat flux decreased in the perturbed cases relative to the control case. To partially compensate for the decrease in latent hearing, sensible heat flux increased in the perturbed cases compared with the control case. The changes in the deforestation case are greater in the latitude belt centered at 5 degrees S, where in most part the Amazonian forest is situated. Otherwise, the changes in the desertification are greater in the latitude belt centered at 15 degrees N. When there ic; also degradation of the African tropical forest (substitution of evergreen broadleaf trees by short grass), the greatest changes occur southward from that region tin the latitude belt centered at 5 degrees N), and the magnitude of the changes are also increased. This shows the important role of the modification of tropical forest when there is degradation of the vegetation in the African region from 20 degrees N to 0 degrees degrees. The results regarding the changes in the temperature and in the energy fluxes are in agreement with those of earlier experiments carried our with sophisticated general circulation models, which shows the usefulness of this kind of simple model

   83:  This paper describes recent developments in climate modeling at Meteo-France related to land surface processes. The implementation of a simple land surface arameterization, Interactions between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA), has gained from previous validations and calibrations at local scale against field datasets and from aggregation procedures devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements for climate purposes are introduced: spatial variability of convective rainfall in canopy drainage estimation and subsurface gravitational percolation. The methodology used to derive climatological maps of land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model from existing databases for soil and vegetation types at global scale is described. A 3-yr integration for the present day climate with a T42L30 version of the climate model has been performed. Results obtained compare favorably with available observed climatologies related to the various components of the continental surface energy and water budgets. Differences are due mostly to a poor simulation of the precipitation field. However, some differences suggest specific improvements in the surface scheme concerning representation of the bare soil albedo, the surface runoff, and the soil moisture initialization. As a first step prior to tropical deforestation experiments presented in Part II, regional analyses over the Amazon forest indicate that the modeled evaporation and net radiation are in good agreement with data collected during the Amazon Region Micrometeorological Experiment campaign

   83:   Investiga-se a influencia da queima de biomassa sobre as concentracoes de O3 troposferico, em regioes proximas as cidades de Goiania e Cuiaba, atraves de analise quantitativa em diferentes intervalos de tempo. Foram caracterizados dois padroes de variacao: padroes sazonal e diurno. Com objetivo de melhor entendimento dos diferentes comportamentos das concentracoes de ozonio nas areas onde ocorre queima de biomassa, dois indices para monitoramento foram definidos: Indice de Queima e Indice de Exposicao. O primeiro descreve os efeitos da queima enquanto o segundo quantifica os efeitos de eventos de curta duracao. Medidas sistematicasnas areas de queima evidenciam o aumento das concentracoes de ozonio durante a estacao seca

   83:   Este trabalho apresenta o desenvolvimento de um algoritmo de controle do tipo auto-sintonizado para controle de sistemas multivariaveis com numero de saidas maior que o numero de entradas. Na aplicacao do algoritmo a dinamica do sistema e suposta desconhecida e representada por uma equacao a diferencas, onde observacoes futuras sao obtidas atraves de observacoes  e entradas passadas. Utiliza-se como exemplo aplicativo o controle de atitude de um satelite de baixa altitude com estabilizacao em tres eixos. As observacoes sao providas por medidas supostamente efetuadas por sensores solares e de horizonte, e girometros. Um algoritmo otimo as usa para estimacao de parametros que definem a atitude do satelite. As entradas sao os tres torques de controle aplicados respectivamente em cada um dos eixos atraves de jatos de gas conforme um simulador de atitude utilizado para os  testes. Ao final do trabalho sao apresentados os resultados dos testes de avaliacao da exequibilidade do procedimento proposto

   83:   Possivel mecanismo causador de instabilidades em escoamentos com geracao de calor foi analisado, abordando as trocas de calor entre um fluido incompressivel e as paredes do duto. Assim, estudaram-se o transporte de calor e os perfis de temperatura num escoamento laminar unidimensional em um duto com paredes finitas, sem trocas radiativas (o que leva a resultados diferentes dos experimentais); impos-se um campo de velocidade senoidal, havendo no duto regioes com e sem geracao de calor de origem reativa. As equacoes acopladas resultantes foram resolvidas por diferencas finitas "up wind". Utilizaram-se oscilacoes senoidais de temperatura na entrada, assim como da velocidade, com valores tipicos de combustores do tipo Helmholtz existentes. Variando a frequencia de oscilacao de 30 a 600Hz, a velocidade do fluido (nitrogenio com propriedades semelhantes aos produtos de combustao de hidrocarbonetos com o ar) de 0,0028 a 0,28 Mach, e tempo de inducao de 0,02 a 0,05s, nao se verificou qualquer instabilidade termica no escoamento

   83:   Cette these est le resultat d'une etude de plusieurs aspects lies directement ou indirectement a la fusion de l'information imparfaite. Cette etude a comporte une evaluation critique,-d'un point du vue theorique, aussi bien que d'um point du vue pratique-, des principaux modeles utilises dans le cadre de la manipulation de l'information imparfaite. Dans la premiere partie de cette these nous etudions des aspects theoriques liees a la manipulation de l'information imparfaite selon trois axes: i)l'acquisition de l'information et sa transformation dans un modele formel; ii)l'evaluation de l'information imparfaite fournie par une source et l'evaluation de la source elle-meme; iii) la combinaison de l'information. Cette etude se porte sur les trois modeles d'incertitude les plus connus dans la litterature: la theorie des probabilites, la theorie des croyances. Dans une deuxieme partie nous presentous deux applications reelles derivees de cette etude. La premiere application se porte sur la conception d'une interface intelligente pour la fusion d'informations provenant des sources heterogenes. Elle se base sur une strategie de combinaison qui offre a un analyse une methode adequate de combinaison selon sa connaissance de la fiabilite (imparfaite) des sources. La deuxieme application concerneun systeme d'evaluation et de combinaison des opinions d'experts dans la cadre de la theorie des possibilites. Avec cette application nous monstrons que le modele possibiliste presente des avantages par rapport au modele probabiliste habituellement utilise pour ce type de probleme. Dans la troisieme partie nous etudions le probleme de la propagation de l'information imparfaite dans un graphe des dependances, pour diminuer le cout algorithmique de ce processus, tout en garantissant la coherence des resultats. Nous proposons une strategie d'elagage du graphe qui peut etre utilisee par une grande classe des modeles d'inceetitude, et en particulier pour les trois modeles cites ci-dessus. Finalement, encore dans la troisieme partie, nous abordons le probleme de la representation informatique de l'information imparfaite, en vue d'implantations efficaces des idees developpees ici. Dans cette partie nous introduisons une structure d'arbre qui diminue le cout algorithimique de la l'information modelisee par la theorie des croyances dans certains cas specifiques

   83:   Descreve-se a aplicacao de um espectrometro que e operado na regiao do visivel, para o diagnostico de um plasma gerado num dispositivo de confinamento magnetico com uma configuracao RFP, denominado CECI. O espectrometro, de modelo HR-640S, da marca Jobin Yvon, provido de uma fotomultiplicadores, foi utilizado para realizar a medida do alargamento Doppler das linhas de emissao, o que permitiu a determinacao da temperatura ionica no CECI que foi da ordem de 2 - 3eV. A temperatura eletronica de 40 - 50eV foi determinada pelo metodo de razao das intensidades das linhas de HeI. A temperatura ionica espectroscopicamente esta em melhor concordancia com a temperatura eletronica de 10eV, obtida com uma sonda eletrostatica. As emissoes de linhas de HeII,HI,CIIeOII foram comparadas com sinais de outros diagnosticos eletromagneticos e estudadas as correlacoes, o que indicou a presenca de instabilidades MHD no plasma observado

   83:   Este trabalho apresenta alguns resultados obtidos num experimento de teste da bobina de controle da velocidade de rotacao do satelite SCD2 e sua eletronica. Foram utilizados no experimento a mesa de mancal aerostatica de um eixo, um magnetometro, um girometro para medicao da velocidade angular da mesa, um sistema de telemetria para aquisicao de dados, o sistema de potencia, composto pela bateria e conversores, alem, e claro, da bobina e sua eletronica. Com isso consegui-se estimar o torque gerado pela bobina, a partir da analise do decaimento da velocidade de rotacao da mesa. As curvas de decaimento, as equacoes e o modelo proposto para a determinacao do torque, bem como os procedimentos de montagem e teste, sao descritos neste trabalho. Mesmo tendo que estimar valores bastante pequenos de torque (da ordem de 10-5 Nm), conseguiram-se resultados proximos dos valores teoricos

   83:   The ionic content of the solutions found in the hydrological cycle component that cross the aerial phytomass (rainfall and throughfall), percolate through the root zone and drain to streams, for tropical rainforest, particulary in Central Amazonia, is examined. The rain waters in tropical rainforest are, in general, acidic and they provide the main chemical input to the rainforest ecosystem. The cycling of elements in the ecosystem, dominated by the transfer of compounds between throughfall and soil solution at shallow depth, contributes a much greater flux than that from rainfall input and stream output

   83:   A statistical analysis is made on throughfall data for a location in a "terra firme" rain forest in central Amazonia. The results show a large variability in water and chemical fluxes. For all the ions there is a variance in the mean value due to the positions of samples collectors. Despite of large variability, throughfall volume is correlated with rainfall. This is not the case for any the chemicals studied. The use of a transect design with collectors at variable positions is shown to be sound. It is concluded that to obtain flux estimates to within 10
   83:   of the mean at 90
   83:   confidence level, about 300 collections are required for the wet period and 200 collections are required for the dry period. It is proposed that in future studies, a minimum of 20 roving gauges over as wide an area as practical be employed to achieve reliable estimates. Sampling programmes should run for a period of at least one year

Devido a sua propria definicao, o modelo e inerentemente paralelo. O modelo formal apresentado restringe-se a deducoes em logica classica de predicados, no entanto o modelo geral e suficientemente flexivel para poder ser naturalmente extendido para logica de primeira ordem, para logicas nao classicas (e.g. logica de mais de dois valores verdade), e para logica nebulosa, alem de permitir a introducao de coeficientes de certeza

   83:   The minimum winter temperature series for the United States Gulf Coast for 1799-1988 (190 values) was subjected to Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis. Significant periodicities in the QBO region (T = 2-3 years) and at T =  3.7, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 12.9, 15.5 and 22 years were detected. Some of these were present in the first half only (1799-1893) while others in the latter half only (1894-1988), indicating a transient nature. Also, more than 50
   83:   of the variance was random. Many of the significant periodicities are seen in other geophysical parameters. Some may be harmonics of the 11 year sunspot cycle and the 22 year Hale magnetic sunspot cycle

   83:   The 50-mbar tropical zonal winds has a predominent QBO mode of an average period of  28 months with variation in the range 21-33 months and amplitudes varying within +- 20 per cent. For the SO, Tahiti minus Darwin (T-D), SST and equatorial rainfall indices, QBO is not the strongest mode. Periods of 3.6 and  6 years are stronger. The QBO modes for these and other parameters (e.g. surface winds and winds in upper and lower troposphere and stratospheric winter temperature at the North Pole) are very irregular, with amplitudes, phases and sometimes even period having large changes with time. It seems that these have little relationship with the 50-mbar zonal wind QBO and may have altogether different origins

   83:   The solar cycle No. 22 which started in 1986 seems to have already passed through a maximum. The maximum annual mean sunspot number was 157 for 1989. The maximum twelve-month running average was 159, centered at July, 1989. For cycle 21, similar value was 165 centered at December 1979. Thus, cycle 22 is slightly weaker than cycle 21. Schatten and Sofia (1987) had predicted a stronger cycle 22 (170 +- 25) as compared to cycle 21 (140 +- 20). Predictions based on single variable analysis viz. Rz (max) versus aa (min) were  165 and came true. Predictions based on a bivariate analyses viz. Rz(max) versus aa (min) and Rz(min) were  130 and proved to be underestimates. Other techniques gave over or underestimates

   83:   In order to determine periodicities in time series from geophysical phenomena, an iterative regression analysis is performed in compliled C language. This program uses a least square regression described by Wolberg [1]; It provides the amplitude, period and phase of individual sine components with their uncertainties. Weighting input data according to their uncertainties is also incorporated

   83:   In countries with generally sparse rainfall, the rainy season is anticipated with hope and foreboding: a poor rainy season in some regions can lead to famine, migrations, abandonment of villages with its attendant social dislocations, and general disruptions in the agricultural economics on which large segments of the population depend. An excessive rainy season can leat to floods, destruction of property, and depletion of topsoil, which also may adversely affect the socio-economic systems. A normal rainy season can mean survival and perhaps even a modicum of prosperity for one more year

   83:   Neste trabalho realizaram-se experimentos com parametrizacoes de cumuli rasos e profundos. Para isto foi utilizado um modelo numerico unidimensional, constituido de uma coluna vertical com parametrizacoes de processos radiativos, superficie, difusao turbulenta de grande escala e conveccoes profunda (esquema de Kuo, 1974) e rasa (esquema de Tiedke, 1984 e Albgrecht et al., 1986). As condicoes iniciais do modelo foram dados de uma radiossondagem da cidade de Manaus-AM. Na primeira parte foi utilizado o esquema de Tiedke com o modelo completo. Observou-se o desenvolvimento de cumuli profundos durante o periodo diurno, em resposta a fonte de umidade em superficie (evaporacao). O aumentou do valor dos coeficientes de difusividade, do esquema de Tiedke, diminuiu a intensidade dos cumuli profundos. A incorporacao da convergencia de umidade de grande escala, em baixos niveis, via forcante externo, intensificou a conveccao e aumentoua taxa de precipitacao. A implementacao do esquema de Albrecht et al. associado ao de Kuo, estando os demais processos desativados, mostrou-se uma boa combinacao. Entretanto, a intensa difusao vertical de grande escala processos secos permitiu que o cumuli rasos fossem ativados, quando o modelo completo foi integrado. A versatilidade do esquema de Albrecht et al. foi verificada atraves da variacao dos parametros inerentes ao esquema (Taxa de entranhamento, umidade relativa critica, etc.).

   83:  A Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis of the geological time series of the oxygen isotope 18 for the last 782,000 years showed 98,000 years as the most prominent periodicity, followed by 40,000 years of less than half the amplitude and still smaller peaks at 24,000, 67,000, 84,000, 107,000 and 786,000 years. Among the astronomical parameters, only eccentricity showed a similar periodicity viz. 96,000 years. Obliquity had a prominent periodicity at 41,000 years which was reflected in the oxygen isotope series also. Corresponding to the bimodal precession peaks (23,000 and 19,000 years), the oxygen isotope series showed a peak at 24,000 years and smaller peaks at 22,000 and 19,000 years. Our results compare well with those obtained by Thomson (1990) with a more sophisticated method

   83:  The  performance of gas dynamic lasers is proportional tothe population inversion created by the nonequilibrium expansion of the lasing gas through a nozzle. The population inversion  is characterized by the small-signal gain coefficient G0 .Previous studies measured Go in constant area ducts located downstream of' minimum length contoured nozzles. 1-3 Some of these studies have reported departures from theory at large distances from the nozzle throat (200h*). Such departures have been attributed to viscous effects and weak shock patterns existing in constant area ducts. These observations and the interest in evaluating the nonequilibrium expansion of the CO2-N2-He: system in a long, noncontoured nozzle motivated this investigation, fly measuring the gain during the gas expansion in the supersonic section of the nozzle, the deleterious effects of shock wave patterns on G0 were avoided. The viscous effects on Go were minimized through the use of relatively high characteristic Reynolds numbers Reo 4.A shock tube 1.5.6 is used to provide a reservoir of hot, highly pressurized, vibrationally excited gas for subsequent expansion through the nozzle. A nonequilibrium population inversion is created when this shock-heated7 gas expands through a double-wedge type nozzle mounted at the end of the shock tube.Small-signal gain measurements are made at three different location along the nozzle centerline for different reservoir conditions. Good agreement between experimental data and the analytical model was observed at the two first stations near the nozzle throat. At the station near the exit of the nozzle, the experimental results are below the theoretical curves

   83:  Previous calculations performed by a waveguide approach to unstable open resonators with cylindrical hyperbolic mirrors are further refined. By this approach, the resonator is regarded as a waveguide mode, to the resonator axis, and resonance is established by self-consistent reflection of a single waveguide mode or of two selectively coupled waveguide modes, from the mirror edges and from the axial region. The refinement refers to improved values for the modal reflection coefficients that appear in the resonance equation. The theory is now shown to be capable of predicting the eigenmode loss behavior in resonators with large Fresnel numbers, as verified by comparisons with published numerical solutions of the resonator integral equation. The theory is also extended successfully to circular hyperbolic mirrors. Finally, the waveguide model is utilized to derive known equivalence relations, previously deduced from the integral equation, between resonators with symmetrical mirrors and those with other arrangements. Thus, the results in this paper lend further support to the validity of the coupled-mode waveguide model for unstable resonators

   83:   A hydrostatic numerical model simple microphysical parameterization is used to simulate moist slantwise convection (MSC) in an archetypal inital condition tree of other kinds of instability. The numerical experiments are designed to explore the roles of rain evaporation and the spatial distribution of humidity on the evolution of the unstable motion. The simulations show that the necessary condition of instability q<0 (equivalent Ertel potential vorticity) becomes less negative in the region where the slanted updraft and downdraft develop. Potential upright instability is generated above the updraft and also below it in the colder sector. The updraft resembles an ageotrophic streak of 200 km perpendicular to the thermal wind vector and drifts slowly into the warmer sector with a velocity of 4,5 km/h , while the parcels near the surface in this sector move toward the updraft. The results indicate the occurrence of a weak low-level jet ahead of the updraft along the thermal wind vector and also a strong high-level jet in the sector. It is found that the surface acts to decrease the value of qe in the colder region in a shallow layer, although this not essentialin the updraft maintenance. Instead, two conditions play important roles in its maintenance: 1) rain evaporation below the updraft and 2) moist atmosphere on the warmside of the updraft. The rainwater evaporation drives an unstable slantwise downdraft into the worm sector and increase the convergence at low levels, maintaining the slanted updraft active for many hours. The difficult in triggering the unstable motion with a small initial perturbation suggests that MSC is perhaps unlikely to occur in nature without a coupled forcing, such as frontogenetical forcing or convective buoyant instability

   83:   The meridional transport of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity is calculated for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The results show that the transport of potential vorticity is negative over most of the atmosphere except over a thin layer near surface where it is positive. Exchange coefficients for the transport of potential vorticity are computed for both the hemispheres using the evaluations of the transport of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity and calculating the meridional gradient of potential vorticity. The volues of the exchange coefficients are used in a simple, two-level quasi-geostrophic numerical model for zonally averaged conditions. The model is applied to the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and the general characteristics of mean annual temperature and zonal wind variation are reproduced reasonably well

   83:   A primitive equations global zonally averaged climate model is developed. The model includes biofeedback mechanisms. For the Northern Hemisphere the parameterization of biofeedback mechanisms is similar to that used by Gutmam et al. (1984). For the Southern Hemisphere new parameterizations are derived. The model simulates reasonably well the mean annual zonally averaged climate and geobotanic zones. Deforestation, desertification and irrigation experiments are performed. In the case of deforestation and desertification in the surface net radiation, evaporation and precipitation and an encrease in the surface temperature. In the case of irrigation experiment opposite changes occurred. In all the cases considered the changes in evapotranspiration overcome the effect of surface albedo modification. In all the experiments changes are smaller in the Southern Hemisphere

   83:   A finalidade deste estudo e determinar as epocas e locais favoraveis a ciclogeneses, assim como descrever os mecanismos que causam ciclogeneses sobre a America do Sul. Um estudo climatologico das ciclogeneses em superficie e realizado para um periodo de 10 anos (1979-1988) de dados. Os resultados mostram que a maior frequencia de ciclogeneses e no inverno e a menor no verao. Uma variacao interanual tambem foi notada, sendo que os invernos dos anos de El Nino de 1983, 1986 e 1987, possuem um maximo de ciclogeneses e o inverno de 1981(de indice de Oscilacao Sul positivo) um minimo de ciclogeneses.  Os invernos de maxima (minima) frequencia de ciclogeneses estao asssociados com precipitacao acima (abaixo) da normal na regiao sul do Brasil. Os resultados de um modelo linear, quase-geostrofico, multinivel e com liberacao de calor latente mostraram que as variacoes sazonais e interanuais da frequencia de ciclogeneses associam-se aos mecanismos baroclinicos. Um estudo de dois casos de ciclogeneses (um de verao e outro de inverno), revelou que os mecanismos baroclinicos e orograficos sao responsaveis pela geracao de ciclones. O caso de inverno, mostrou que os mecanismos baroclinicos foram as causas da formacao do ciclone. Durante o deslocamento inicial do ciclone, notou-se a interacoa da onda topografica com o ciclone. No caso de verao, a formacao do ciclone ocorreu por efeitos orograficos e a intensificacao do ciclone por baroclinicos. As analises de correlacao da altura geopotencial nao filtrada e filtrada com passa alta exibiram um padrao tipo onda que se propaga para leste, inclina-se para oeste com a altura. Os efeitos orograficos aparecem quando a onda aproxima-se dos Andes.

   83:    Apresenta-se uma nova analise da distribuicao de precipitacao sobre as porcoes oeste e central da America do Sul Tropical a partir dos dados de um total de 226 estacoes pluviometricas. Procurou-se relacionar a variabilidade espacial e temporal observadas a aspectos dinamicos da circulacao atmosferica, principalmente a componente divergente do vento em 200 mb. Discute-se diversos aspectos da grande varibilidade tanto espacial como temporal (sazonal e intrasazonal ). Verificou-se que, durante o verao austral, os maximos de precipitacao estao aparentemente ligados a influencia da ZCAS (Zona de Convergencia do Atantico Sul). Durante todo o ano, a Cordilheira dos Andes desenpenha um papel fundamental; ao mesmo tempo que induz a formacao de regioes com valores muito baixos e muito altos de precipitacao nas sua encostas, tambem cria, provavelmente, as condicoes para a ocorrencia do maximo

   83:  The horizontal shear stresses and turbulent sensible heat fluxes were estimated for various unstable situations of the atmospheric boundary layer over a deforested area in the central Amazonian region. Preliminary results at three hour intervals of these quantities, during 14 days of observations in the dry season, are presented in this paper. The results were obtained within the limits of applicability of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory

   83:  Tanto os experimentos como as publicacoes aqui apresentados tem como objetivo geral contribuir para o conhecimento cientifico do ambiente espacial brasileiro atraves do estudo in-loco, da ionosfera e da alta atmosfera na na faixa de altura de cerca de 80 km a 600 km. Ate o momento, pelo que este autor tem conhecimento, as publicacoes apresentadas neste fasciculo, todas das produzidas pela Arca de Ciencias Espaciais e Atmosfericas (CEA) do INPE/MCT, sao as unicas publicacoes cientificas do Brasil, sobre Fisica da Alta Atmosfera e lonosfera, ate agora elaboradas utilizando dados obtidos por instrumentacao de fabricacao propria embarcada em foguetes, Talvez seja interessante ressaltar aqui que foi como resultado de tais experimentos, que nasceu no ambito da CEA, faz alguns anos, a ideia de se construir um satelite cientifico. Ate o momento ja foram realizados 10 (dez) experimentos utilizando foguetes. Como nao ha limite de tempo para a publicacao de trabalhos resultantes desses experimentos, a presente publicacao e editada em fluxo continuo, ou seja, e reeditada a medida que surgem novos experimentos e novas publicacoes. Somente sao consideradas aqui as publicacoes em revistas especializadas com revisores referees. Nao sao consideradas as publicacoes simplesmente apresentadas em simposios. Sao consideradas entretanto, aquelas publicadas nos anais dos respectivos simposios, desde que com referees. "Para fins de ilustracao, introduzimos nesta edicao algumas fotos das cargas utilizadas nos experimentos em epigrafe. As fotos foram tomadas pelos Engenheiros Agnaldo e Narli e pelo Dr. B. R. Clemesha do Laboratorio Laser do INPE. Em geral,  principalmente no passado, essas cargas uteis eram construidas no INPE e integradas a baia de voo no Instituto de Aeronautica e Espaco (IAE) do Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial (CTAE/M.Aer). Nos ultimos experimentos houve um esforco crescente para realizar a terceirizacao, ou seja, a inclusao da industria privada na construcao da carga util, atraves da transferencia de tecnologia do INPE e do IAE para a industria privada. Os dados dos lancamentos dos Sonda III que constam nas tabelas deste relatorio foram gentilmente fornecidos pelo En. Roberto Caetano de Souza, gerente do veiculo Sonda III, do Instituto de Aeronautica e Espaco. Os lancamentos mencionados foram executados no Centro de Lancamento da Barreira do Infemo (CLBI/MAer) ou no Centro de Lancamento de Alcantara (CLA/MAer). Vale ressaltar que a partir do ano de 1994, esses experimentos tem sido bastante assessorados cientificamente, pelo campus do INPE na Universidade do Estado do Maranhao, onde estao instalados atualmente uma digissonda, um magnetometro e um radar ionosferico. No experimento IONEX II, executado no CLA em 18/12/96 o radar teve um papel vital para o experimento, pois foi de que detectou a presenca da bolha ionosferica, dentro da qual o foguete deveria passar. Esse radar e o unico instrumento de solo capaz de detectar a presenca da bolha ionosferica.

   83:  A historia da presenca brasileira na Antartica esta intimamente ligada as pesquisas que o INPE passou a conduzir na regiao a partir da criacao do Programa Antartico Brasileiro em 1982. De la para ca, e principalmente apos a Instalacao dos primeiros modulos da Estacao Comandante Ferraz, no verao 83/84, atraves de um trabalho incansavel de nossa Marinha, inumeros experimentos puderam ser realizados em diferentes areas do conhecimento e os importantes resultados obtidos tem proporcionado avanco significativo na compreensao dos fenomenos que ali ocorrem. Mas, tudo isto seria impossivel de ser realizado caso nao existissem a determinacao do governo brasileiro em proporcionar o devido apoio para o seu Programa Antartico e o pioneirismo de muitos cientistas que, com competencia e criatividade souberam vencer as dificuldades que a regiao impoe. Esta publicacao e um belo exemplo da determinacao dos pesquisadores do INPE que conduzem trabalhos na regiao. Dedico a eles a minha homenagem

   83:  O mes de marco de 1991 caracterizou-se por chuvas bem acima do normal no estado de Sao Paulo, causando grandes enchentes na Capital. O episodio coincidiu com a organizacao da Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul sobre a Regiao SE, com aparente modulcao associada a Oscilacao de 30/60 dias no final do mes.Uma analise detalhada do episodio de 19/03 revelou a ocorrencia de uma oclusao na costa do rio Grande do Sul, com desenvolvimento extremamente rapido, cuja frente chegou rapidamente a Capital, onde estacionou durante o dia 19. O episodio poderia ter sido previsto com relativa precisao com os prognosticos do Centro Nacional Americano e do Centro Europeu de Previsao de Tempo a Medio Prazo. O presente episodio mostou a necessidade de maior integracao de dados e previsoes meteorlogica dos centros mudiais, ede tecnicas de monitoramnto e analise por radar e satelite no setor opercional.Mostra, tambem, a necessidade de treinamneto do pessoal operacional para que fenomenos que nao se enquadram nos esquemas tradicionais de previsao possam ser identificados com maior antecedencia. Operacao em tempo integral tambem deveria ser mandatoria nos centros operacionais de previsao

   83:  Este trabalho apresenta uma nova heuristica para problemas de cobertura de conjuntos baseada em uma relaxacao Surrogate Continua e em um metodo de otimizacao de subgradientes. Nos propomos um controle do tamanho do passo adequado para a relaxacao Surrogate, o qual prove bons limites em poucas iteracoes dos subgradientes, quando comparado com outras relaxacoes. Alem disto, o algoritmo combina testes de reducao do tamanho do problema e uma tecnica para evitar a ordenacao preliminar durante a solucao da relaxacao Surrogate Continua. Outra caracteristica do trabalho e a definicao de uma estrutura de dados eficientes de modo a resolver problemas de grande porte (1000 linhas por 12000 colunas) em micro-computadores. Os testes computacionais indicam resultados de melhor qualidade que os de um algoritmo baseado em uma relaxacao Lagrageana, principalmente em relacao ao tempo computacional

O experimento, que sera lancado a bordo de um balao estratosferico, possui uma resolucao angular de 1o,7 em um campo visada de 10oX10o (FWHM) com uma sensibilidade de 7 10-5 fotons cm-2 S-1 KeV-1 na faixa de 30 a 100 KeV, para uma atmosfera residual de 3,5 g cm-2 e um tempo de integracao de 104s. Com essa sensibilidade o experimento esta apto a fazer imagens das fontes mais brilhantes do Hemisferio Sul, com especial atencao para o Centro Galactico. Novas imagens em raios-X desta regiao ainda pouco estudada sao as principais contribuicoes do experimento para o desenvolvimento da astrofisica de altas energias

   83:   Em satelites para observacao da Terra, e necessario um Sistema de Controle de Atitude (S.C.A.) na estabilizacao, pois mesmo que o veiculo seja precisamente orientado no lancamento ( com rotacao correta), este tende a se desviar desta orientacao devido a influencia de torques ambientais, mudancas internas e acoplamentos da dinamica de atitude com a dinamica orbital e flexivel do satelite A configuracao do S.C.A. adotado (um volante de inercia e duas rodas dde redas de reacao ) apresenta forte acoplamento entre "roll" e "yaw", tratando-se, portanto, de um sistema multivariavel, enquanto o eixo de "pitch"e praticamente desacoplado  O modelo linear da dinamica de atitude deste satelite apresenta incertezas devido as dinamicas nao modeladas dos paineis flexiveis e a variacao do acoplamento giroscopio, provocado pela mudanca na velocidade do volante de imercia Utilizou-se para o projeto do S.C.A. operando no modo normal, a metodologia LQG/LTR ( "Linear Quadratic Gaussian/Loop Transfer Recovery"). Esta metodologia e inerentemente uma metodologia de projeto para sistemas do tipo "MIMO", onde a estrutura do compensador e conhecida pro "MBC", a mesma de compensadores LQG Ela reune abordagens tanto no dominio do tempo como no dominio da frequencia, e apresenta a grande vantagem de  tratar a robustez a nivel de projeto As especificacoes do projeto no dominio da frequencia, usuais para sistemas do tipo "SISO", como margens de fase e de ganho, banda passante, caracteristicas de rejeicao a pertubacoes e insensibilidade a variacao nos parametros, sao estendidas para o caso "MIMO"atraves do conceito de valores singulares. A metodologia LQG/LTR basicamente permite a recuperacao das exelentes caracteristicas quanto a robustez de sistemas LQR qundo o estado nao e completamente medido. Entretato as especificacoes no dominio do tempo sao de dificil tratamento. Devido a facilidade de utilizacao  da metodologia  e aos resultados obtidos nas simulacoes terem sido bastante satisfatorios , concluiu-se que a metodologia LQG/LTR e uma opcao bastante atraente para o projeto de S.C.A.'s quando o modelo de projeto e do tipo "MIMO"

Os pos foram preparados pela co-precipitacao de hidroxidos de Ce e de Zr a partir dos respectivos cloretos e a retirada da agua (secagem) foi efetuada pelo uso da liofilizacao (sublimacao). Os resultados sao comparados com aqueles para pos e para ceramicas obtidas a partir de co-precipitados secos de forma convencional e com valores da literatura internacional

   83:  The method presented in [1] for ranking alternatives by using fuzzy numbers is discussed as far as computational aspects are concerned. An alternative procedure is presented which allows for the use of any convex and normalized fuzzy set to assess the contribution of each alternative to some overall objective, according to a set of criteria. The procedure also allows the criteria to be structured in nlevel hierarchies. An example is presented to illustrate the algorithm

Neste trabalho e descrito o metodo de preparacao de pos de CeO2-ZrO2, que envolve a precipitacao e desidratacao dos sulfatos de Ce e Zr com etamol e isopropanol seguida da calcinacao. As caracteristicas fisicas e morfologicas dos pos (aglomerados) sao relacionadas com os comportamentos na compactacao a verde e na densificacao por sinterizacao. O po tratado com alcool etilico apresenta as melhores caracteristicas de compactacao e sinterizacao

   83:  The position of the free cut problem is the particular assortment problem where the board supplier procedures boards of a fixed length and offers the user the opportunity to specify a free cut at the same point on every boardy. The problem is to determine that point which will minimise overall waste when customer ordens como to be cut. A heuristic procedure is proposed for this problem. Several potentially good cutting positions are identifield from a feasible solution of the cutting stock problem using the large original board length as the stock size. These cutting positions are further analysed to select the best one. Limited computational tests performed in a few test problems showed promising results

   83:  The problem of determining the optimal length of a board with fixed width from which panels have to be cut to satisfy some specified demand with minimum waste is analysed. The proposed procedure generates a lower bound on the best solution that can be obtained for each one the board length values within the allowed range. This lower bound contour is updated each time after a potentially good board length is analysed. The search stops when the solution is within a pre-specified error. This new algorithm is much better than a previously suggested method by Ynasse, Zinober and Harris to solve the same problem

   83:  Apresenta-se uma aplicacao de Animacao por Computador com seus problemas e necessidades envolvendo o uso da Dinamica para a simulacao do movimento. Um dos maiores problemas em se fazer Animacao por computador e criar movimentos que parecam o mais natural e realistico possivel. Uma alternativa e o uso da Dinamica para o controle dos movimentos, onde os objetos sao tratados como tendo massa e outras propriedades fisicas, agindo sob influencia de torques e forcas externas e internas. Uma das dificuldades com essa tecnica e a determinacao das forcas e torques requeridos para cada movimento e para isso e necessario aplicar as leis fisicas que regem o movimento

   83:  Aplicou-se uma tecnica para a deteccao de flutuacoes na radiacao cosmica de fundo (RCF), a qual supoe que a RCF possa ser descrita por um campo gaussiano. Realizou-se procura de flutuacoes em dois mapeamentos de ceu, um no comprimento de onda de 3,3 mm e 12 mm, ambos com campo de visada de 7. (FWHM). Embora tivessem sido observadas duas regioes no mapa de 3,3 mm, uma "quente" e outra "fria", a um corte de sinal de 2 (ou 95,45
   83:   C.L.), estas nao puderam ser classificadas com "Hot" e "Cold Spots", pois as duas estruturas apresentaram areas menores que a coberta pelo feixe do experimento

   83:  Neste trabalho e proposto uma ferramenta que podera integrar uma interface grafica com um ambiente para a geracao de sistemas especialistas. O uso da ferramenta esta dividido em tres fases. Inicialmente o usuario, de forma interativa, especifica suas necessidades de acordo com o problema a ser tratado. Na segunda fase, estas especificacoes sao utilizadas pelo gerador para selecionar, de uma biblioteca, os modulos que contem as funcoes necessarias para estruturar um sistema especialista. Estes modulos sao integrados em um sistema unico que pode ser compilado. Finalmente, o sistema compilado pode ser utilizado para desenvolver um sistema especialista para resolver o problema inicial. A ferramenta sera provida ainda de primitivas graficas e mecanismos  para a integracao de algoritmos externos necessarios a manipulacoes especiais de imagens. A mativacao para a implantacao de ferramenta veio da necessidade de se construir sistemas especialistas com diferentes neveis de complexidades para o dominio de processamento de imagens. Uma outra motivacao e a possibilidade do uso da ferramenta num laboratorio de pesquisa e ensino em representacao de conhecimento de conhecimento e arquitetura de sistemas especialistas. esta ferramenta e a parte de inteligencia artificial de um projeto mais amplo de um laboratorio inteligente para o processamento de imagens, onde atividades de pesquisa e desenvolvimento  de produto possam ser executadas de forma eficiente. O modulo de geracao de motores de inferencia, cuja especificacao e implementacao representa a principal contribuicao deste trabalho, e descrito em detalhes, tambem sao apresentados os embasamentos teoricos dos componentes do modulo e detalhes da implementacao deste trabalho

   83:  Atualmente, com o aumento vertiginoso da capacidade de processamento dos computadores, previsao de tempo passou a ser algo factivel e de extrema importancia para a comunidade. Dado que o meteorologista trabalha normalmente com uma grande quandidade de dados, a representacao grafica dos seus dados associada com imagens de satelites ou radar e um recurso muito importante para o estudo do comportamento do tempo. Assim, muitos dos Sistemas de Vizualizacao de Dados Meteorologicos tem provado serem ferramentas poderosas para os meteorologistas. O autor, baseando-se na experiencia que adquiriu trabalhando no INPE no projeto do sistema de visualizacao de dados meteorologicos MicroMAGICS e no trabalho de pesquisa realizado no Space Science and Engineering Centre em Madison-EUA, onde estudou formas de geracao de graficos tridimensionais, analisa neste trabalho alguma das principais caracteristicas destes sistemas e sugere algumas alternativas para o seu desenvolvimento. Tambem descreve com pormenores um algoritmo de geracao de superficies que pode ser empregado para a visualizacao de varias grandezas fisicas, em especial, as relacionadas com clima. O desenvolvimento e a implementacao deste algoritmo sao o cerne deste trabalho

   83:  Este trabalho estuda a aplicacao de estimacao de estado, via filtro estendido de Kalman, na determinacao de atitude de um telescopio embarcado em balao estratosferico. Trata-se de um experimento em Astrofisica - o projeto MASCO - que requer uma precisao de apontamento com erro maximo de 20 minutos de arco na fase de estabilizacao. Para a determinacao de atitude sao utilizados tres eixos de giroscopios, sensor solar de dois eixos e magnetometro de tres eixos. O modelo cinematico do giroscopio substitue o modelo dinamico do movimento do telescopio no filtro de Kalman e a atitude e parametrizada em quaternions. Uma segunda configuracao de estimacao utiliza ganho de Kalman constante para simplificacao dos calculos e reducao do tempo de processamento. Os desempenhos das duas configuracoes sao analisadas e comparadas atraves de simulacoes em computador digital

   83:  Este trabalho apresenta um estudo sobre o impacto dos perfis verticais de temperatura e de umidade estimados a partir de radiancias obtidas pelo TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), nos resultados gerados por um modelo diagnostico de analise sinotica sobre a regiao Sul e Sudeste do Brasil. O processamento das radiancias do TOVS, sondador que opera a bordo dos satelites meteorologicos de orbita polar da serie TIROS-N/NOAA, foi feito utilizando o International TOVS Processing Package-4 (ITPP-4), analises numericas do National Meteorological Center (NMC) e dados meteorologicos convencionais. A partir dos perfis verticais de temperatura e de umidade obtidos inicialmente, foram gerados campos de temperatura, altura geopotencial, agua precipitavel, indice de instabilidade e adveccoes de temperatura e de umidade nos niveis-padrao de pressao. Esses campos foram utilizados no estudo de um caso de chuvas intensas ocorridas no dia 19 de marco de 1991, na Grande Sao Paulo e na regiao litoranea. Os resultados foram comparados com as analises do NMC e com a situacao meteorologica observada nas imagens de satelite. Com base nos resultados, conclue-se que, em geral, o impacto dos dados de satelite e positivo, especialmente pela disponibilidade de dados na regiao oceanica e pela alta resolucao, tanto espacial como temporal. Verifica-se tambem que ha boa concordancia entre os resultados TOVS e a situacao meteorologica observada nas imagens satelite

   83:  Neste trabalho sao analisados os dados referentes as observacoes realizadas no segundo voo do experimento SUPERNOVA, desenvolvido pelo grupo de astrofisica de altas energias da Divisao de Astrofisica do INPE. Este telescopio, capaz de detectar raios-  na faixa de energia de 150KeV a 2MeV, era composto de dois detectores de NaI(T1) (proporcionando uma area geometrica total de 648,5cm2) e colimadores determinando um campo de visada de 25o (FWHM) para fotons incidentes com energia abaixo de 300KeV. Montado sobre uma plataforma estabilizada em azimute e elevacao, o experimento voou a bordo de um balao estratosferico em 4 de dezembro de 1988 durante cerca de 12 horas, a uma altitude media de 36Km, para observar a supernova SN1987A. Os espectros da supernova foram analisados para determinar os parametros da linha de 847KeV proveniente do decaimento radioativo do 56Co formado durante a explosao dessa estrela. Tambem foram analizados os espectros integrados para determinacao da evolucao temporal do fluxo proveniente da supernova SN1987A

   83:   Neste trabalho e discutida a validade da utilizacao, em regioes tropicais, de modelos desenvolvidos para avaliar processos hidroquimicos em regioes temperadas. Para tal, sao apresentados resultados da aplicacao do MAGIC ( Model of Acidification of Groundwater InCatchment), que avalia impactos ambientais e processos de acidificacao, para larga escala de tempo, em pequenas bacias de drenagem. Esse modelo foi aplicado a bacia do igarape Barro Branco (Amazonia Central) para ilustrar seu potencial para estudos hidrogeoquimico nessas regioes. Atraves de dois estudos de caso, procura-se mostrar quais sao as necessidades em termos da determinacao de parametros e variaveis, para que os resultados obtidos com esse modelo sejam uteis na avaliacao de impactos ambientais em regioes tropicais. Sao apresentadas as seguintes hipoteses para avaliar a alteracao na bacia: (1) aumento significativo nas entradas totais de calcio, potassio e magnesio, em funcao da conversao total da regiao em pastagem (as entradas totais para o sistema, apos o desmatamento, apresentam valores iguais aos do pre-desmatamento) e (2) aumento significativo das entradas totais das especies ionicas majoritarias para a bacia, em funcao do desmatamento em larga escala na regiao circunvizinha (as entradas totais para o sistema, apos o desmatamento, apresentam valores superiores aos do pre-desmatamento). Os dois estudos de caso sao analisados considerando a possibilidade de mudanca climatica. Os resultados obtidos atraves do MAGIC, embora qualitativos, sao consistentes com as descricoes dos processos hidroquimicos observados nessa regiao, nao apresentando valores discrepantes. Demonstra-se que esse modelo pode ser empregado para realizar estudos hidrogeoquimicos em regioes tropicais. Porem, e reconhecida a necessidade de avaliar alguns parametros-chave no modelo, como a fase solida do aluminio e a quantidade de materia organica no solo e na agua. Para que as previsoes obtidas atraves da modelagem representem quantitativamente os processos hidroqumicos da regiao em estudo, sao necessarios dados historicos para calibracao e validacao do modelo e, portanto, o monitoramento de campo e indispensavel

   83:  The summer monsoon rainfall series for 29 subdivisions of India were subjected to Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis for detecting periodicities and to Multiple Regression Analysis for estimating their amplitudes and standard errors. For almost all the subdivisions significat QBO ( Quasi-biennial Oscillations, T = 2-3 years) were noticed and were found to be transient i e strong during some intervals and weak in other intervals. Hence meaningful predictions were not possible. For some subdvisions, significant periodicities near sunspot cycle (11+-1 years) and Hale solar magnetic cycle (22 +-1 years) were noticed. For some regions ( western part of India), some association of droughts and El Nino/Southern Oscillation phenomenom was noticed. However, this relationship was one-sided. Whereas a large number of El Ninos were associated with below-normal rainfall, a large number of droughts had no corresponding El Ninos. All that one can say with some confidance (80) is that the All India summer monsoom rainfall will probably not be above average in El Nino (warm episode) years and will probably not be below average in La Nina (cold episode) years. Regession models using several parameters also do not seem to be very satisfactory as yet

   83:  The relationship between El Nino  (warm episodes) and La Nina (cold episodes) and rainfall in NE and South of Brazil is very loose. In some El Nino years, the rainfall at Fortaleza in DJF (December, January and February) could be above average while rainfall in MAM (March, April, May) may be below average (or vice-versa). On the average, deviations at Fortaleza (CE, NE Brazil) are slightly negative than those at Porto Alegre and Bage (RS, South Brazil) are slightly positive during El Nino years. However, for individual events, the deviations can be from large positive to large negative. Hence, predictions can be very uncertain and hazardous

   83:    A two-layer statistical-dynamical (SD) primitive equations model is used to simulate the mean annual sea surface temperature (SST) and its seasonal cycle. The model includes parameterizations of friction, diabatic heating and atmospheric large-scale eddies. At all latitudes the surface is considered to be covered only by water. Since no acean dynamics are included in the model it investigates how well the surface energy balance alone determines SST. The simulations performed with the SD model are compared with the observations and GCM studies. The results show that the gross characteristics of the mean annual SST and its seasonal cycle are well simulated by the model. The simulated seasonal cycle of SST agrees in phase with the observation , and the differences between the computed and observed maxima are lower that 1 degree C. However the amplitude of the simulated seasonal cycle is higher than the observed one mainly in the extra-tropical latitudes. Although the differences between the SST simulated by the model and the observations may be attributed to the absence of dynamical and physical ocean processes, the results  suggest that the radiative processes play a fundamental role in determining the SST pattern

   83:  A conversao de areas de florestas tropicais em pastagens pode levar a significativas consequencias microclimaticas, fazendo-se necessario, para sua avaliacao, modelar a micrometeorologia do dossel da floresta e da pastagem que substitui, considerando parametrizacoes que englobem adequadamente todos os processos relevantes. Assim, desenvolveu-se um modelo com base na solucao iterativa da equacao do balanco de energia, para a determinacao da temperatura da superficie, em diassem precipitacao pluviometricas, em areas desflorestadas (pastagem) e no dossel da floresta. Utlizam-se, como dados de entrada, as medidas do fluxo de radiacao solar global, da velocidade  do vento, da temperatura do ar e do solo, alem de propriedades fisicas e fotometricas do solo e do dossel, incluindo as resistencias estomaticas maximas e minimas da cobertura vegetal. Para a verificacao dos fluxos resultantes, utilizando-se medidas obtidas em experimentos micrometeorologicos realizados na regiao da floresta tropical da Amazonia central, selecionado-se para apastagem a Fazenda Dimona (2.19'S; 60.19'W) e, para a floresta, a Reserva Ducke (2.57'S; 59.57'W), ambas situadas em regiao de terra firme. A estimativa, atraves do modelo, de todos os fluxos componentes do balanco de energia, apesar de pequenas discrepancias, representou bem os dados medidos. O mesmo ocorreu para as escalas micrometeorologicas de quantidade de movimento, calor e vapor d'agua. Estes resultados mostraram que o modelo, utilizando poucos parametros, permite avaliar com confianca, em dias sem precipitacao pluviomentrica, a particao de energia, tanto em areas de pastagem quanto de floresta tropical umida de terra firme, na regiao amazonica

   83:  O efeito da liberacao de calor latente sobre a instabilidade baroclinica foi estudado usando o modelo desenvolvido por Bonatti e Rao. Este modelo incluio efeito de liberacao de calor latente como parametrizado por Mak. Usando um perfil de vento zonal linear e TVVT contante de -6 K/Km, os efeitos dos termos dissipativos e da variacao da intensidade e do perfil vertical do aquecimento sobre a instabilidade baroclinica sao estudados, alem das caracteristicas dos modos instaveis para este problema. Os termos dissipativos, assim como o tipo e a intensidade do aquecimento alteram a selecao do modo mais instavel. O atrito e o resfriamento estabilizam modos mais curtos enquanto que a friccao cumulus instabiliza modos com pequenos comprimentos de onda (~1000 Km). Com perfis de aquecimento com duplo maximo e perfis de estado basico observados para a regiao monsonica da India encontrou-se caratacteristicas de estrutura vertical, comprimento de onda e velocidade de propagacao proximos as caracteristicas de verao do Hemisferio Norte. A inclusao do aquecimento mostrou-se necessaria para a obtencao das caracteristicas de escala observadas. A inclusao de dissipacao por atrito e resfriamento altera, em alguns casos, as caracteristicas do modo mais instavel, selecionando um modo de Green. A distribuicao vertical dos termos de convercao de energia para modos de Charney mostrou-se confinada abaixo da media troposfera enquanto que para modos de Green esta distribuicao e mais extensa

   83:  O radio espectrografo solar de alta sensibilidade que utiliza uma antena parabolica de 9 metrosde diametro, com montagem polar, esta operando regularmente desde dezembro de 1990. O espectrografo opera numa banda de frequencia de (1600  100) MHz, com altas resolucoes temporais (20  100 ms)e em frequencia (0,3-3 MHz). Os dados sao registrados em filme 35mm preto e branco e tambem digitalizados. As caracteristicas do espectrografo e da antena para varias elevacoes sao descritas em detalhes. As limitacoes do espectrografo e os planos futuros sao tambem apresentados. Ate janeiro de 1992, cerca de 162 grupos de explosoes solares foram registrados pelo espectrografo decimetrico. As explosoes foram classificadas em duas categorias principais: i)microondas e ii)explosoes decimetricas, geradas, respectivamente, devido ao mecanismo girossincrotronico e pela interacao do feixe de eletrons com o plasma. Os parametros observacionais de 44 grupos de explosoes decimetricas, tais como densidade de fluxo observada, duracao total, tempos de excitacao e descida, sugerem que sejam explosoes tipo IIIRS decimetricas e sejam geradas no segundo harmonico pela interacao do feixe com o plasma. A densidade de eletrons do feixe estimada e da ordem de 10exp4 cm-3.

   83:  Pela primeira vez, explosoes solares na faixa de frequencia de 18 a 23 GHz foram observadas com resolucao temporal de 0,6 segundos e diametro do Radio Observatorio do Itapetinga. Estudamos as "explosoes simples" em microondas associadas a fase impulsiva dos "flares" solares. Analisamos os espectros das explosoes de baixa intensidade (densidade de fluxo < 100 SFU) para a investigacao dos: i) processos de aceleracao (impulsivo ou continuo) dos eletrons emissores e ii) mecanismos de emissao gyrosynchrotron (termico  ou nao-termico). Esta analise sugeriu que o processo de acelaracao dos eletrons emissores e impulsivo (com um tempo de aceleracao da ordem de 1 segundo) e o que o mecanismo de emissao desses eletrons e nao termico (com energia da ordem de 100 keV). Estimamos o espectro medio observado, sugerindo que explosoes simples de baixa intensidade podem estar associadas as "injecoes discretas de eletrons". Tambem estimamos os parametros tipicos para a fonte da emissao de microondas sugerindo que essas explosoes sao geradas em uma regiao densa da cromosfera onde o nivel de densidade eletronica e da ordem de 10exp10 cm-3 com um campo magnetico de 300 Gauss.

   83:  Neste trabalho, sao examinados os efeitos das ondas de gravidade sobre as emissoes de O2(b1 +g, 0-1) e OH*(9-4) presentes no nightglow (luminescencia atmosferica noturna) da regiao da mesopausa (entre 80 a 100 Km). O trabalho compoe-se de duas partes: a analise espectral das flutuacoes quase-perioodicas nas intensidades do nightglow (taxas de emissao aparente) e temperaturas rotacionais, proporcionadas pelo experimento MULTI2, e uma interpretacao teorica destas medidas, baseada em um modelo fotoquimico-dinamico de uma atmosfera com efeitos difusivos. Admite-se que os eventos ondulatorios nas intensidades e nas temperaturas das bandas de emissao sejam resultados de mudancas na camada de airglow geradas pela passagem de ondas de gravidade. A razao de Krassovsky n, quociente entre a fracao das flutuacoes da taxa de emissao e temperatura, e o parametro utilizado para comparar os valores teoricos aos observacionais. Com relacao a emissao de O2(b1 +g, 0-1), doze eventos com ondas monocromaticas foram anlisados, possuindo periodos aparentes entre 42min e 142min. As medidas das amplitudes de no2(b) exibiram uma tendencia de crescimento em periodos de onda longos concordando com as predicoes do modelo. As medidas da fase de nO2(b) positivas e proximas a zero, tambem em acordo com o modelo presente. No caso da emissao de OH*(9-4), oito eventos com ondas monocromaticas foram pesquisados, com periodos aparentes entre 41min e 126min. Os valores de nOH* estao em concordancia com o modelo, principalmente em periodos de ondas longos. Este trabalho ressalta a importancia de ralizarem-se medidas conjuntas da estrutura horizontal das flutuacoes, bem como a velocidade dos ventos (efeito Doppler) na regiao da mesopausa.

   83:  Magnetic fluids are synthetic materials that combine in a single medium the properties of fluids and magnetic materials. The action of a magnetic feild on the magnetic fluid allows the design of new types of bearings and also provides conventional ones with new properties.This work presents a contribuition to the study of the lubrication if linear isothermal non-conformal contacts with magnetic fluids under the action of a nonuniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the contact. The fluid is assumed to present extrinsic superparamagnetism. The regime of lubrication considered is the isoviscous-rigid. The analitycal approach adopted considers small perturbations of the classical analytical solution already known for this type of contact. The main objectives of the work are:  * To establish the equations and assumptions that are necessary to treat the proposed lubrication problem * To analyze the impact of the change in the apparent viscosity of the magnetic fluid on the thickness of the lubricating film due to the presence of the magnetic field  * To develop an experimental technique able to deal with the problems that arise with the use of magnetic fluids in the lubrication of a two-disc machine  The mathematical treatment of the proposed problem brings together the analytical methods adopted in fluid film lubrication to the magnetic-liquid fluid dynamics (ferrohydrodynamics) usually adopted to study the flow of magnetic fluids that present extrinsic superparamagnetism. The result is a coherent system of equations supported by a well defined set of assumptions. The solution obtained allows the study of the eventual change of the film thickness that can be achieved by the aplication of a magnetic field across the contact.  The work also discusses the experimental technique necessary to study the problem in a two-disc machine that runs with minute amounts of lubricant, applies a magnetic field across the contact and measures the film thickness by a capacitance method. The work concludes by showing theoretically that the film thickness can be either increased or reduced depending on the magnetic and viscous properties of the fluid and the supported by experiments with a magnetic oil in a two-disc machine

   83:  O objetivo deste trabalho e utilizar um metodo de regressao interativa na determinacao de periodicidades em series temporais geofisicas. Este metodo fornece os desvios associados aos tres parametros de cada periodicidade determinada, o que possibilita selecionarem-se amplitudes que apresentem uma maior relacao amplitude/desvio. O metodo utilizado e comparado ao metodo do periodograma, a analise de Fourier e a analise espectral por maxima entropia. Em seguida, foi aplicado a analise  das principais periodicidades em series temporais da atividade de cosmonuclideos atmosfericos (carbono 14 atmosferico e berilio 10 acumulado em testemunhos de gelo da Groenlandia e da Antartica), temperaturas medias de superficie e indicadores da presenca de poeira vulcanica. No periodo coberto nessas series, as periodicidades encontradas foram comparadas no ponto de vista de possiveis ligacoes causais entre os fenomenos envolvidos (atividades solar, presenca de cosmonuclideos na atmosfera terrestre, circulacao atmosferica, temperaturas da atmosfera e aerossois vulcanicos na atmosfera).

   83:  Apresenta-se o desenvolvimento de ferramentas computacionais, derivadas da modelagem estatistica, para sintese, a analise e o processamento de imagens de radar de abertura sintetica. Diversos problemas de imagens sao enfocados de forma unificada, dentro do contexto Bayesiano. O modelo de Potts-Strauss e empregado como distribuicao a priori para as classes, e sao estudadas: a tecnica de estimacao por maxima pseudoverossimilhanca, as propriedades de convergencia de algoritmos de aglomerados e a invariancia da classe de distribuicoes Markovianas para a distribuicao a posteriori de uma imagem, dada a sua versao borrada e ruidosa. Especificamente, sao devolvidos, de forma computacionalmente tratavel, os estimadores de pseudoverossimilhanca para o modelo de Potts-Strauss e um numero arbitrario de classes. As propriedades de convergencia sao estudadas com uma experiencia Monte Claro, pelo uso dos estimadores de pseudoverossimilhanca como criterio de parada. E apresentada uma extencao do teorema de Geman e Geman (1984), sobre a invariancia dos campos Markovianos que permite modelar imagens com ruido multiplicativo, entre outras. Utilizando-se os resultados sobre o modelo de Potts-Strauss, e desenvolvida uma ferramenta para a simulacao de imagens opticas e de radar. Estudam-se varias distribuicoes e estimadores de parametros adequados para o ruido em imagens obtidas por iluminacao coerente. Propoe-se e desenvolve-se uma modificacao de um algoritmo Markoviano (ICM) para segmentacao de imagens SAR e opticas, cujos parametros sao estimados iterativamente, pelos estimadores de pseudoverossimilhanca, para automatizar o seu uso. propoe-se o uso de filtros robustos, baseados nas propriedades de distribuicao Rayleigh e uma analogia entre filtragem e estimacao, para a reducao de ruido speckle em imagens de uma visada e detecao linear. Desenvolve-se uma ferramenta computacional para avaliar a aderencia de amostras de imagens as distribuicoes propostas como modelos de ruido, e essa informacao e empregada na discriminacao de tipos de ocupacao do solo. Avalia-se, pelo uso de tecnicas Monte Claro, a influencia que o formato dos dados tem no desempenho dos testes de aderencia.

   83:  Ozone measurements in the Brazilian Amazon Basin have been conducted recently at ground level and with soundings (Kirchhoff, 1988; Kirchhoff et al., 1988) and in aircraft (Browell at al.,1988). Continuos surface data exist since 1985 for a site close to Cuiaba. Mato Grosso (MT), in the southern fringe of the Amazon forest (Kirchhoff, 1990), and strong effects of biomass burning have been detected in ozone concentrations during the dry season, from June through October (Kirchhoff et al., 1989b; Kirchhoff, 1990). The dry season coincides with the burning season, for centuries a time when fire has been used to clear areas where forest was recently cut and let to dry, or to renew pastures and agricultural land. The tropospheric zone which results is produced by complex and multiple photochemical reactions between different compounds emitted by biomass burning (Fishman et al. 1979). Ozone monthly averages in southern Amazonia have ranged from a maximum of almost 80 parts per bilion (ppb) in September during the peak of the burning to 10 to 20 ppb in the wet season, from December to April. The low values are comparable to those found year round in nonpolluted sites such as Natal, at the Brazilian northeast coast (Kirchhoff, 1990). Detection of fires in the brazilian Amazonia with band 3 (3,55 u to 3,93 u) thermal images of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the meteorological NOAA series satellites was developed by Pereira (1988) and is in operational use (Setzer and Pereira, 1990a, 1990b, 1991a and 1991b). Coupling of pixels containing fires detected in such images and atmospheric contamination hundreds of kilometers downwind in Amazonia has been reported (Andreae et al. 1988; Kirchhoff et al. 1989). Total number of fire pixels detected in the dry season in the Brazilian Amazonia were about 315.000 in 1987, and 210.000 in 1988. In this chapter results of ozone measurements made on board the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) airplane during the first week of September 1989 are presented and analyzed in relation to the temporal and geographical location of fires detected by the satellite before and during the sampling period

   83:    A parametrization scheme for the Interaction between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA), has been implemented in the French spectral general circulation model (GCM) Emeraude. ISBA represents surface physical processes including the variability of soil hydrological properties and the influence of vegetagion cover on the exchanges between the soil-cover system and the atmosphere. The main characteristics of the scheme, and the more recent improvements concerning the tropical rain forest, are briefly described. The method used to derive the maps of the surface parameters is also presented, Two 3 year experiments with and without ISBA are compared, with special emphasis on the results at specific locations where observations are available. The general features of the model climatology are found to be independent of the inclusion of the scheme. With ISBA, the model gives a lower surface soil temperature, mainly owing to an increased surface albedo, and an intensification of the hydrological cycle. A more striking response to the inclusion of ISBA is the improved partitioning of the surface energy budget, which then agrees moderately well with the observations over different systems of land cover. A comparison with previous GCM experiments with new land surface parametrizations shows that the models with the new schemes are in better agreement with each other and with the observations over the Amazon region

A estacao situa-se nas coordenadas geomagneticas 19,1 S, 15, 6.L; L=1,19, proxima ao centro da Anomalia Magnetica do Atlantico Sul (coordenadas geograficas: 27.S, 53.W). As componentes do campo geomagnetico sao medidas por um magnetometro tipo "fluxgate", com boa sensibilidade para estudos de micropulsacoes. A analise dos 60 dias de dados (marco-maio de 1991) medidos em Santa Maria possibilitaram obter: o comportamento de alguns parametros das micropulsacoes atraves do espectro de potencia do sinal; a relacao que existe entre estes parametros para dias quietos e perturbados; uma comparacao entre os parametros obtidos e os que existem na literatura das micropulsacoes em baixas latitudes. A literatura das pulsacoes Pc3-4 mostra um maximo diurno de ocorrencia para as baixas latituddes (L=1,5-3,0). Para as latitudes muitas baixas (L<1,2), as observacoes mostram um maximo ao anoitecer. Este maximo ao anoitecer atribui-se aosefeitos da corrente chafariz na regiao da Anomalia Equatorial de Appleton. As pulsacoes observadas em Santa Maria nao mostram o maximo ao anoitecer, levando a concluir que as mesmas nao sofrem os efeitos da Anomalia Equatorial. Os resultados obtidos para as pulsacoes Pc3-4 em Santa Maria mostram ocorrencias de micropulsacoes diurnas, com maximos proximos ao meio-dia local (15:00 UT). Estas pulsacoes Pc3-4 sao controladas continuamente pelo vento solar. As ondas "upstream" originarias de regiao de choque penetram na magnetosfera acoplando-se as oscilacoes estaveis das linhas de campo atraves do mecanismo de ressonancia gerando predominantemente as pulsacoes Pc3-4 diurnas detectadas nessas estacoes de baixas latitudes. Os resultados para as pulsacoes Pc5 mostram um pico maximo diurna de ocorrencia proximo ao meio-dia local. Este pico tem origem nas ondas superficiais geradas pela instabilidade Kelvin-Helmholtz na magnetopausa que penetram na magnetosfera.

   83:  Este trabalho expoe um modelo teorico visando a descricao de um "swirler" axial com diametro menor ou igual ao duto de ar secundario, sendo o "swirler" instalado a jusante do duto. O presente modelo contribui para compreensao deste tipo de retentor de chama. Os testes mostraram facilidade no controle dos aspectos dinamicos da chama e das suas dimensoes, o que traz maior flexibilidade para os processos de otimizacaao de camaras de combustao. Este controle foi comprovado atraves do uso de tecnicas de Processamento e Tratamento de Imagem. Os resultados experimentais tambem revelam que o emprego do "swirler" em questao com numeros de "swirl" elevados tornam a chama plenamente est†vel.

   83:  A evolucao temporal e espacial (vertical) da camada limite planetaria atmosferica maritima em regioes subtropicais Ç investigada por meio de estudo observacional e numerico. Para tanto, foi realizada uma campanha de medidas onde foram feitas sondagens simultaneas do oceano e da atmosfera na regiao de Cabo Frio (23.S e 42.08'W). Para o estudo numerico foi utilizado um modelo de fechamento de segunda ordem, proposto por Mellor e Yamada (1982), acoplado a um modelo de camada de mistura oceanica (CMO) para determinar a temperatura da CMO em termos do balanco de energia. Embora a campanha de medidas tenha sido feita durante a passagem de um sistema frontal, o que restringe a utilizacao dos dados, comparacoes entre as simulacoes e as observacoes indicam que a camada de mistura atmosferica simulada Ç consistente com as observadas durante o experimento, bem como Ç similar Ö observada por Fitzjarrald e Garstang (1981) durante o GATE. Os perfis verticais simulados das variancias das componentes zonal, meridional e vertical da velocidade sao tipicos de casos nos quais a forcante mecanica Ç a principal responsavel pela formacao da camada de mistura (regime de conveccao forcada). O aumento da temperatura da camada de mistura oceanica, simultaneamente ao aprofundamento da CMO, est† associado Ö adveccao de aguas quentes da corrente do Brasil e costeiras. As simulacoes da profundidade da CMO indicam que o crescimento observado da CMO durante o experimento foi intensificado pela subsidencia da Agua Central do Atlantico Sul

   83:  Nesta pesquisa foram desenvolvidos modelos de transferencia radiativa em ondas curtas, de carater fisico-matematico, em condicoes de ceu aberto (MTR-CA) e de ceu totalmente nublado (MTR-CN), para calculo de radiancias emergentes no topo da atmosfera tendo em vista a calibracao vicaria de sensores VIS que operam a bordo dos satelites meteorologicos METEOSAT-3 e METEOSAT-4. Foram concebidas as seguintes opcoes de modelos: (1) atmosfera de apenas uma camada de mistura composta de ar e aerossois (MTR-CA-1c); (2) atmosfera de duas camadas, uma composta de apenas de ar e aerossois e outra sobreposta composta apenas de ar (MTR-CA-2c); e, (3) atmosfera composta de ar e aerossois acima de uma camada de nuvens estratiformes (MTR-CN). Foram escolhidos alvos (oceano profundo, arenito e campo de nuvens estratiformes), na regiao nordeste do Brasil, na busca de caracteristicas radiativas estaveis. Os resultados foram avaliados atraves de testes de sensibilidade, validacao e comparacoes de coeficientes de calibracao. As radiancias calculadas apresentaram valores fisicamente consistentes para todos os testes de sensibilidade. Os modelos foram validados pelas comparacoes com o LOWTRAN-6, com radiancias obtidas de imagens de satelite (LANDSAT-5 e METEOSAT-3) e com resultados teoricos ja publicados. Os MTR-CA desempenharam-se bem e para o MTR-CN foi possivel constatar que a variabilidade espacial e temporal da espessura optica do campo de nuvens estratiformes torna este alvo pouco estavel e, assim sendo, nao muito apropriado para fins de calibracao. Nos procedimentos de avaliaáao foram estimados coeficientes de calibracao utilizando radiancias de imagens horarias do METEOSAT-3 e METEOSAT-4. Os valores do coeficiente de calibracao apresentaram-se consistentes com os utilizados pelo ESOC (0,56;0,35), para imagens digitalizadas em 8 bits

   83:  Neste trabalho estuda-se o processo de interceptacao da precipitacao pluviometrica pela cobertura vegetal da floresta tropical umida amazonica do tipo terra firme. Utilizam-se modelos numericos com bases fisicas bem definidas para a simulacao do processo e obtencao de um valor medio das perdas por interceptacao, na regiao da Reserva Ducke, Manaus/AM, Amazonia Central. Os modelos utilizados sao o SiB (Simple Biosphere Model), calibrado para o local por Sellers et al. em 1989 e o modelo especifico ao processo de interceptaáao denominado modelo de Rutter (Rutter et al., 1971) implementado para o local por Lloyd et al. em 1988. O objetivo desta parte do trabalho e a comparacao dos resultados obtidos pelos dois modelos. Paralelamente, foram idealizados e implementados experimentos observacionais para a determinacao da interceptacao em mais dois pontos distintos da Amazonia: a Reserva Biologica do Jaru, municipio de Ji-Parana/RO na Amazonia Ocidental e o outro a Reserva da Vale do Rio Doce, municipio de Maraba/PA na Amazonia Oriental. A metodologia destes experimentos se baseia no trabalho de Lloyd e Marques de 1988. Os resultados obtidos com a modelagem do processo indicaram um comportamento bastante similar do SiB comparativamente ao modelo de Rutter, porem, com um valor estimado acima do observado para a regiao. A diferenca, no entanto, esta dentro do intervalo de erro na determinacao do valor observado. Para o periodo estudado, na Reserva Ducke, o modelo SiB estimou um total de perdas por interceptaáao que equivalem a 10,9
   83:   da precipitaáao incidente total. O indice do modelo de Rutter foi de 12,9
   83:  . Observou-se para a regiao de Ji-Parana um valor de 12,5
   83:   para as perdas por interceptacao, no periodo de agosto de 1992 a junho de 1993. Em Maraba, a interceptacao representou 13
   83:   da precipitacao incidente do periodo de setembro de 1992 a junho de 1993. Espera-se dar prosseguimento ao experimento observacional por pelo menos mais um ano

   83:  Analisam-se fluxos de radiacao em tres ecossistemas amazonicos: Campina e Campinarana localizados na Estacao Experimental de Silvicultura Tropical (2.34'S;60. 2'W) e Mata densa situada na Reserva Florestal Ducke (2.57'S; 59. 57'W), para os periodos setembro de 1991 e agosto/setembro de 1993. Foram instalados em cada area de estudo no topo de uma torre, um conjunto de equipamentos composto por piranometros para medir os fluxos de radiacao de onda curta e infravermelha incidentes e refletidos, alem de um saldo radiometro. Proximos a superficie do solo, sob os dosseis, foram usados 16 radiometros para medir radiacao de ondas curtas refletida e 16 para medir radiacao fotossinteticamente ativa (PAR). A aquisicao dos dados foi efetuada com dois "microloggers"21X e dois CR-10, que possibilitaram obter-se medias de 1 minuto a partir de valores amostrados de 3 em 3 segundos entre 5:50 e 18:00 h, para todos os parametros observados. Nos 16 pontos de observaáao de radiaáao, tomaram-se fotografias hemisfericas, utilizando-se uma camara Nikon equipada com lente olho de peixe de 8 mm. Em complementacao as medidas de radiacao foi determinada a quantidade de Sunflecks. Avaliaram-se de forma detalhada a atuacao dos componentes do balanco de radiacao e a aplicacao da metodologia proposta por Steege (1994), que permite estimativas de indices de vegetacao e de parametros climaticos atraves da interpretacao de fotografias hemisfericas. Constatou-se nao existir diferencas entre o albedo de ondas curtas dos tres dosseis: campinarana (10,4
   83:  ), mata densa e campina (11,3
   83:  ). Quanto ao albedo na faixa do visivel, na campinarana foi de 1,4
   83:  , na campina 1,4
   83:   e na mata densa 2,0
   83:  ; ja o albedo na faixa espectral do infravermelho proximo, na campinarana foi de 20,2
   83:  , na mata densa 21,2
   83:   e na campina 22
   83:  . Verificou-se que na base do dossel de campina chega 5 vezes mais radiacao de ondas curtas e infravermelha, e 6 vezes mais PAR que na base do dossel de mata densa. As medidas de radiacao na base dos dosseis apresentaram grande variacao espacial e temporal. Equacoes obtidas mostram que o albedo modelado em funcao do angulo de elevacao do Sol, e os saldos de radiacao e de radiacao de ondas longas, estimados em funcao da radiacao de ondas curtas incidente, apresentam otima precisao. Constatou-se, ainda, que a utilizaáao da metodologia de interpretacao de fotografias hemisfericas representa uma ferramenta muito importante nos estudos de regeneracao dentro de dosseis, pois alem de proporcionar estimativas de parametros climaticos, tem a vantagem de possibilitar determinacoes de parametros como o indice de area foliar (LAI) e a cobertura de dossel sem destrui-lo

   83:  Os seres humanos sao habeis para identificar as direcoes de fluxo em redes de drenagem. provenientes de representacoes como fotografia areas ou imagens de sensoriamento remoto.Aparentemente, a geometria bi-dimensional de uma rede e em muitos casos suficiente para se derivar as fontes e destinos de uma drenagem, a partir de um procedimento automatico que nao necessitaria de informacoes adicionais, como declividades e alturas do terreno. A formalizacao do problema de tal forma que o mesmo possa ser automaticamente solucionado, tem mostrado as dificuldades em se  derivar automaticamente as direcoes de fluxo em umarede de drenagem. Para o processo de inferencia das direcoes de fluxo e importante se fazer uma analise mais detalhada dos elementos principais que compoem um rede de drenagem. Este trabalho de dissertacao faz um estudo detalhado dos componesntes de uma hidrografia atraves da formalizacao dos seus elementos principais pontos de cabeceira, embocaduras, juncoes, lagos, ilhas, baseados na estrutura matematica de grafos.ê apresentado como certos processsos de inferencia podem ser representados em termos dos grafos, identificando possiveis simplificacoes na complexidade da rede de drenagem. Em adicao a formalizacao dos elementos da rede,esta dissertacao desenvolve um modelo computacional para se derivar automaticamente a embocadura de uma bacia hidrografica, e consequentemente as ordens dos rios. Este modelo computacional se baseia exclusivamente na conectividade dos canasis e nos angulos formados pelos canais em juncoes

   83:  Nesse trabalho apresentamos os resultados de um experimento aeronomico denominado MULTIFOTO que envolveu dois equipamentos operando de solo: um radar de laser sintonizado na linha NaD do sodio e um fotometro multicanal,alem de uma carga util contendo 10 fotometros lanáada em foguete tipo sonda III, Ös 23:52 (TL) do dia 31/05/92 no Centro de Lanáamento de Alcantara (2,3.S; 44,4.O). Via foguete foram obtidos perfis em altura das emissoes das bandas O2A(O-O) e OH(8-3), do Sistema O2 Herzberg I, das linhas OI557,7 nm e NaD e do continuo a 578 nm. As medidas de solo possibilitaram conhecer o perfil em altura da concentraáao de sodio mesosfÇrico e a temperatura rotacional da banda OH(9-4). Esse representa o primeiro conjunto onde tais medidas foram obtidas simultaneamente e em regiao equatorial. Analisamos entao a utilizaáao desses dados para a determinaáao das concentraáoes de O, O3 e H em alturas mesosfericas, discutindo a fisico-quimica envolvida. Nossos resultados mostram a adequaáao dos parametros propostos por McDade et al. (1986a) para descrever as emissoes O2A(O-O) e OI557,7 nm, tambem em regiao equatorial. Os dados referentes Ö emissao OH(8-3) conduzem a coeficientes de quenching do OH(8) da mesma ordem de grandeza que os propostos por McDade et al. (1987). O conjunto das probabilidades de transiáao proposto por Turnbull e Lowe (1989) se mostrou adequado Ö analise desses dados. Apresentamos os primeiros resultados para concentraáao de ozonio mesosferico determinada a partir dos perfis simultaneos de emissao e de concentraáao de O3 e H que obtivemos nao sao discrepantes dos dados existentes na literatura, embora nossos valores para concentraáao de H estejam acima do esperado. Essa diferenáa, no entanto, pode ser atribuida Ö indeterminaáao no parametro    que descreve a emissao NaD.

   83:  Este trabalho estuda a interaáao de chuvas de meteoros com a baixa ionosfera terrestre. A analise, utilizando a tecnica de radiopropagaáao em VLF (frequencia muito baixa: de 10-30 kHz), abrange o periodo de 1966 a 1994. Esta tecnica permite o estudo da interaáao dos meteoroides e a regiao situada entre 60 e 90 km de altura, cujo conhecimento Ç extremamente pobre. A analise de trajetos transequatoriais de sinais de VLF permite o monitoramento das principais chuvas de meteoros que ocorrem nos hemisferios sul e norte. Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com os detectados por radar mete¢rico para as chuvas mais significativas. O monitoramento de 28 anos de dados continuos de sinais VLF permitiu o estudo da variabilidade dos feixes associados Ös chuvas de meteoros, bem como a estimativa dos parametros fisicos e quimicos das particulas meteoricas e da regiao considerada.

   83:  Um enlace em 44,893 MHz, com propagaáao obliqua e 1160 km de distancia entre transmissor (localizado em Santa Maria, RS, 29.43 S, 53.43 O, coordenadas geograficas; 18.42'S, 14.42'O, coordenadas magneticas), e receptor, (localizado em Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, 23.11 S, 45.53 O, coordenadas geograficas; 12.42'S, 22.36'O, coordenadas magneticas), cuja finalidade principal era o estudo da potencialidade de comunicaáao via espalhamento em rastros ionizados de meteoritos, foi instalado em Setembro de 1991, tendo operado ate Dezembro de 1991. Junto com os dados de espalhamento meteorico forma observados, no periodo de Out a Dez 91, uma alta incidencia de ecos nao meteoricos de alta amplitude e longa duraáao. Neste trabalho foi demnstrado que, por suas caracteristicas, esses ecos nao meteoritos podem ser oriundos de espalhamento em camada E-esporadica. Foi tambem comparada a incidencia desses ecos recebidos em 44,893 MHz  com os ecos de camada Es observados pela ionossonda vertical de HF (digissonda) de Cachoeira Paulista (22.42'S, 45. O, coordenadas geograficas; 11.42'S, 23.24'O, coordenadas magneticas), no mesmo periodo de Out a Dez 91. A conclusao desta comparaáao Ç que, levarmos em conta nos dados da ionossonda vertical so os ecos cujo mecanismo de propagaáao foi o espalhamento, ha uma boa concordancia na razao de incidencia desses com a incidencia observada em 44,893 MHz. Um mecanismo que gera irregularidades de pequena dimensao capazes de espalhar ondas de radio de comprimentos de onda especificos, baseado na presenáa de gradiente ma concentraáao eletronica e campo eletrico com direáao e intensidade adequadas, na faixa de alturas da camada Es, proposto originalmente por Reid (1968), foi testado para os dados em 44,893 MHz e para os dados recebidos pela ionossonda vertical de HF (digissonda) de Cachoeira Paulista. Este mecanismo mostrou ser viavel para explicar a presenáa de ecos propagados por espalhamento observados tanto nos dados de 44,893 MHz quanto nos da digissonda.

   83:  O termo Plasma na fisica, foi utilizado pela primeira vez por dois fisicos americanos, Langmuir e Tonks no ano de 1923, quando estudavam oscilaáoes de cargas no espaáo, e deram o nome deste estudo de oscilaáoes de plasmas. A palavra plasma vem da medicina onde Ç utilizada para apontar perturbaáao ou estado nao distinguivel. Denominou-se plasma a parte coagulavel do sangue, onde nao se sabia exatamente o que era. O Plasma Ç um conjunto de particulas carregadas e neutras que satisfazem determinados criterios, e sao chamados de conjunto quasi-neutro de particulas. Os electrons e ions constituem o plasma e sao produzidos atraves de ionizaáao de atomos e moleculas, a recombinaáao de electrons e ions, faz com que o plasma emita radiaáao, que pode ser visivel ou nao. Se a radiaáao for no espectro visivel, a cor da luz emitida pelo plasma vai depender do tipo de gas utilizado, por exemplo o hidrogenio a cor do plasma Ç azul. O Plasma so se forma em condiáoes especiais, aqui na superficie da Terra, nao Ç possivel obter palsma sem que este esteja confinado, isto Ç possivel em camaras de vacuo, muito utilizado em laboratoris de estudos de plasma. Devido a foráa gravitacional da terra ser fraca para reter o plasma, nao Ç posiivel mante-lo confinado por longos periodos como acontece no sol, o sol, assim como todas as estrelas queemitem luz e o centro do planeta Terra se encontram no quarto estado da materia. Na ionosfera terrestre, temos o surgimento da Aurora Boreal, que Ç um plasma natural, assim como o fogo. O objetivo da fisica de plasma Ç o estudo de sistemas gasosos ionizados e macroscopicamente neutro. Sao sistemas compostos de por um grande numero de particulas carregadas, distribuidas dentro de um volume (macroscopio) onde haja a mesma quantidade de cargas positivas e negativas.

   83:  Diagnostics of plasmas confined by magnetic fields for fusion research based on neutral lithium beam (nlb) is presently considered to be one of the most appropriate methods to carry out the important measurements of edge density and its fluctuation profiles without plasma perturbation. In this CRP project we proposed the development of an nlb source with 1-10 keV based on a traditional B-eucrypite surface emission souce coupled to a Pierce gun geometry accelerator and subsequent neutralization of the Li+ beam by a Li-oven neutralizer. Possibli application of such an nlb probe in a medium term (2-3 years) in our country would be in a small RFP in operation and in a low-aspect-ratio tokamak in construction both at LAP/INPE and in other hot plasma devices operating at brazilian universities of Sao Paulo (USP) and Campinas (UNICAMP) with whom we maintain strong collaboration efforts in plasma research.

   83:   The effects of different equator-crossing times on the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data record are examined. A simple procedure proposed by Kousky and Kayano (1994) is used to reduce these effects. Large-scale interannual modes of OLR within the tropics are determined by performing empirical orthogonal function analyses on OLR anomalies and on bias-corrected OLR anomalies. Both analyses result in two physically meaningful leading modes, which describe different large-scale anomalous features of the OLR related to the southern oscillation. A mode related to changes in the satellite observing system is found only in the analysis for the uncorrected OLR anomalies. Evidence is presented indicating that estimates of the mean daily OLR are affected by changes in the equator-crossing times due either to the replacement of satellites or to long-term drifts from the orbital plane during the lifetime of individual satellites

Outros objetivos deste trabalho sao discutir os modelos ionosfericos existentes na literatura e descrever o desenvolvimento de um modelo fisico dependente do tempo para a ionosfera da Terra. Para o desenvolvimento deste modelo adotamos o metodo apresentado por Bailey et al. (1993). Aqui tambem vamos discutir os resultados de um estudo comparativo dos perfis da concentracao eletronica modelada com um conjunto de observacoes feitas pelo radar de espalhamento incoerente em Jicamarca (Bailey et al., 1993). Os valores das concentracoes eletronicas calculadas e observadas apresentaram boa concordancia, exceto durante a noite. A discordancia durante a noite provavelmente Ç devido as diferenáas entre as velocidades dos ventos neutros previstas pelo modelo de vento termosferico HWM90 e aquelas que realmente ocorrem nas latitudes equatoriais da America do Sul.

   83:  An automatic speech-to-text transformer system, suited to unlimited vocabulary, is presented. The basic acoustic unit considered are the alophones of the phonemes corresponding to the Portuguese Language spoken in Brazil (PLB). The input to the system is a phonetic sequence, from a former step of isolated word recognition of slowly spoken speech. In a first stage, the system eliminates phonetic elements that don't belong to PLB. Using knowledge sources such as Phonetics, Phonology, Orthography and PLB specific Lexicon, the output is a sequence of written words, ordered by probabilistic criterion that constitutes the set of graphemic possibilities to that input sequence. Pronunciation differences of some regions of Brazil are considered, but only those that causes differences in phonological transcription, because those of phonetic level are absorbed, during the transformation to phonological level. In the final stage, all possible written words are analyzed for Orthography and Grammar point of view, to eliminate the incorrect ones.

   83:  Este trabalho tem por objetivo formular e resolver uma nova variante de conhecido "Problema de Lambert's", um dos mais importantes e discutidos topicos em mecanica celeste. A ideia Ç substituir a exigencia de que a transferencia seja completada num tempo dado (problema original) pela exigencia de que o consumo de combustivel envolvido nessa manobra seja minimo. Esse problema Ç resolvido atraves do desenvolvimento de equaáoes analiticas para as componentes do impulso aplicado e teoria de minimizaáao de funáoes. A seguir sao feitas simulaáoes para a comparaáao entre os resultados obtidos por essa teoria e resultados disponiveis na literatura. Esses resultados podem ser facilmente estendidos para o estudo de uma transferencia bi-impulsiva entre duas orbitas Keplerianas coplanares com minimo consumo de combustivel

   88:  coplanar orbits
   88:   impulse maneuver
   83:  In the present research we consider the problem of optimal (minimum   V) time-free N-impulse transfers between any two coplanar orbits, for the cases where N<4. For the two-impulse maneuver, we develop optimality conditions that lead to a non-linear system of three equations and three unknowns. The solution of this system gives us the bi-impulse transfer with minimum total  V. For the three impulse maneuver, we develop a new approach. We use two elliptic transfer orbits that are connected by a negligible impulse applied at an infinite distance from the main body. It is an extension for the bi-eliptic transfer, where the two orbits involved in the transfer are not co-axial. We study in detail and show regions of optimality for the most trivial cases of transfers: between two circular orbits; one circular and one elliptic orbit; two elliptic co-axial orbits. We complete the paper by developing a scheme to reduce the total  V for some ot those maneuvers, by adding a second impulse at infinity, and making it a four-impulse maneuver.

   83:  This paper is concerned with trajectories to transfer a spacecraft between the Lagrangian points and the Earth. The Lagrangian points have important applications in astronautics, since they are equilibrium points of the equation of motion and very good candidates to locate a satellite or a space station. The planar circular restricted three-body problem in two dimensions is used as the model for the Earth-Moon system, and Lamaåtre regularization is used to avoid singularities during numerical integration required to solve the Lambert's three-body problem. Relations with previous  results are shown, specially with: i) Transfers between the Lagrangian points and the Moon; ii) Search for the absolute minimum  V transfer between the Earth and the Moon; iii) Use of L, as a node for lunar exploration

Most of the material presented here are of general interest for those studying orbital maneuvers. Several possibilities of mathematical models for the dynamics and for the actuators are explained. Classical and modern methods are shown. Although it is not the main objective of this paper, suggestions for new techniques are presented.

   83:  This paper studies transfer orbits in the planar restricted three-body problem. In particular, we are searching for orbits that can be used in two situations: a) To transfer a spacecraft from one body back to the same body (known the literature as the Henon's problem); b) To transfer a spacecraft from one body to the respective Lagrangian points L4 and L5. To avoid numerical problems during close approaches the global Lamaåtre regularization is used. Under this model, the Henon's problem became a Lambert's three body problem, as defined and explained later in this paper.

   83:  We study and classify the Swing-By maneuvers that use the planet Jupiter as the body for the close approach. Our goal is to simulate a large variety of initial conditions for these orbits and classify them according to the effects caused by the close approach in the orbit of the spacecraft. We use the well-known regularized (Lamaåtre regularization) planar-restricted-circular-three-body problem as our model. We specially check which ones of those orbits have a passage near the Earth. This is very important, because only those orbits have a potential use of transfers from the Earth. We show our results in letter-plots, where one letter describing the effects of the Swing-By is plotted in a two-dimensional graph that has an horizontal axis the angle  (the angle between the perigee vector and the Sun-Jupiter line) and in vertical axis the Jacobian constant in the spacecraft. We make one plot for each value of the perigee distance (the distance between the spacecraft and Jupiter during the close encounter)

   83:  The problem of transfer orbits from one body back to the same body (the Moon or a planet) is formulated as a Lambert's problem and solved by Gooding's Lambert routines. We consider elliptic as well a circular orbits for the Moon or a planet and any kind of orbit (elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) for the spacecraft. The solutions are plotted in terms of the true anomaly instead of the eccentric anomaly) for several cases. We show that the use of the true anomaly simplifies the solutions in several ways. We also solved the problem of transfers from this body to the corresponding L4 and L5 points. After that, the same problem is studied in terms of the  V and the time required for the transfer. Among all the possible transfer orbits, a small family with almost zero  V was found. The properties of these orbits are shown in details

   83:  The problem of capture and scape of comets is still a controversial problem in Celestial Mechanics. The number of short-period comets (period < 200 years) seems to be larger than it should be, based in the actual flux of near parabolic comets entering the Solar System and the models knowm for the captures. In our paper, we address this problem by numerical integration of a large number of trajectories of possible comets. We use the regularized (Lamaåtre regularization) planar-circular-restricted-three-body-problem as our basic model. As initial conditions for our trajectoires, we choose the parameters: Jacobian constant (J), the distance Xc (from the center of mass to the point where the comet crosses the Sun-Jupiter line) and the crossing angle (0). The trajectoires were integrated backward and forward in time and we calculated the energy and the angular momentum ofthe comet before and after the encounter. Then we classify the orbits according to the effects of the close approach. Our results consist of letter-plots, which means that the plot a letter that describes the effect of the close encounter in a two-dimensional diagram having the parameter Xc in the horizontal axis and the parameter 0 in the vertical axis. We make one plot for every value of the parameter J. With those plots we make histograms to show the distribution of the pericenter distance and the semi-major axis (equivalent to orbital period) of the captured comets. We conclude that: the probability of capture has a maximum of 3,6
   83:   at J = -1,15; more than 95
   83:   of the captured comets will have pericenter distance less than 5 AU, what makes them visible when passing near their pericenter, about 70
   83:   will have an orbital period smaller than 200 years.

Our goal is to simulate a large variety of initial conditions for those orbits and study them according to the effects caused by this close approach. The practical importance of this topic is to allow mission designers to explore close approaches with planets in a more realistic model, as well as to take advantage of the atmospheric effects, when it is possible. We use the well-known planar restricted circular three-body problem plus atmospheric drag as our model. We integrate numerically the equations of motion forward and backward in time, until the spacecraft is in a distance that we can consider far enough from the planet's effect and consider the system formed by the Sun and the spacecraft as a two-body system. At these two points we can use the two-body celestial mechanics to compute energy, angular momentum and the Jacobian constant before and after the close approach

   83:  In this paper the problem of sending a spacecraft from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to the Moon with minimum fuel comsuption is considered. It is assumed that the "Two-Body model" approximation is valid in all phases of the mission and that the final orbit around the Moon is polar. The first part deals with impulsive maneuvers, and obtain a set of values for fuel expenditure and trip time for several trajectories. Two possible scenarios are considered: a single mission (only one spacecraft in orbit around the Moon) and a double mission (one main spacecraft and a sub-satellite around the Moon). A more detailed study, including a  V in each phase and analysis of the effects of the errors involved in the final orbit around the Moon, for one of the trajectoires, is also presented. The second part considers the use of low-thrust trajectoires. The Euler-Lagrange equations are used to generate a set of differential equations that are numerically integrated to obtain the final orbit. The difficulty caused by a lack of initial values for all variables in the same point (Two point Boundary Value Problem) is treated by making interations in the initial values of the Lagrange multipliers, using the gradient projection method. The results showed that large savings in fuel consumption can be obtained by using low thrust trajectoires for the Earth-Moon part of the mission. A first analysis for the behavior of the orbit around the Moon, including predictions for the frequency and  V for station-keeping maneuvers, is also included.

   83:  Lamaitre's regularization as the model for the simulatons. Transfers with near-zero  V to the Lagrangian points exist in this model. Next, we study the swing-by maneuvers. The fundamentals of the theory and some practical applications are presented, including a classification of Jupiter or Moon swing-bys. The effect of the atmospheric drag is later included, and we study aerobraking in swing-by maneuvers. We also study the effect of a swing-by with Jupiter on comets. A large range of initial conditions has been used for the incoming comets. The main questions considered are: the probability of capture of a comet in the Solar System; the distribution of captured comets according to pericenter distance and semi-major axis; the percentage of captured comets that will have a short period. Another important problem is the question of time-free minimum  V transfers between any two eliptical coplanar orbits. A set of analytical equations to solve this problem for a multi-impulsive maneuver is derived and solved. Comparisons between those maneuvers are made. Then, the Lambert problem is studied. We define and solve a new version of the problem, where the transfer is time free, but has to be completed with minimum  V.

   83:  A long-term predictive model, MAGIC, was applied to a Central Amazonian catchment area to ilustrate large scale deforestation effects on 'islands' of preserved areas, for the situations with and without climate changes. In addition,model sensitivity in response to different organic matter levels in the soil and stream waters as well as to different Al solubility constants was evaluated. The model output was strongly dependent on the chosen values of organic matter concentration and Al solubility constant. Application of the model to a 30 yr deforestation  program revealed increases in streamwater ionic concentrations with or without climate change, although streamwater ionic concentrations were predicted to be higher as a consequence of climate change. On the centennial scale, streamwater ionic concentrations reach a new equilibrium, with concentrations higher than those prior to the surrounding deforestation. With the assumed increased cation deposition to the preserved forest areas,soil exchangeable cation concentrations increase with time and aluminum is released to solution. At the end of the simulated deforestation program, SO2-4 (sulfate ion) in the preserved areas began to be relased to streamwater, inducing acidification. Application of the MAGIC model makes possible to estimate, for the rainforest environment, water quality changes as a function of different climate and land use changes

   83:  Este trabalho apresenta uma sugestao de metodologia factivel para o processso de avaliacao de propostas de projetos de pesquisa e desenvolvimento bastante heterogeneos, como os existentes no Instituto de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), bem como para uma subsequente alocacao de recursos orcamentarios entre as propostas aprovadas. A sugestao apresentada busca atender a todas as condicoes estabelecidas na Reuniao Especial de Planejamento do INPE ocorrida em setembro de 1991 em Cachoeira Paulista, quando se decidiu que as propostas de trabalho do Instituto deveriam ser reavaliadas e concorrer entre si, com base no merito individual, pelos recursos orcamentarios de 1992. A metodologia proposta baseia-se em um processo de atribuicao de conceitos segundo uma funcao multi dimensional detalhadamente discutida no texto, a qual busca levar em conta as peculiaridades do INPE e as condicionantes de contexto mencionadas anteriormente. Um conceito final associado a cada proposta resultaria da agregacao de avaliacoes individuais efetuadas por membros de um Comite Tecnico. Estes conceitos finais serviriam de base para um processo deterministico de distribuicao de recursos orcamentarios. Embora a metodologia proposta tenha sido talhada para atender condicoes muito especificas vigentes para o INPE naquele periodo, o autor acredita que a ideia geral do metodo apresentado e muitas das sugentoes especificas possam ser adaptadas a situacoes diversas e representar uma contribuicao efetiva para o equacionamento de problemas analogos.

   83:  Este trabalho foi concebido e desenvolvido no primeiro semestre de 1992, como uma contribuicao do setor espacial ao projeto oficiosamente denominado "Plano 2010", cuja elaboracao era anunciada Ö epoca pelo Secretario de Ciencia e Tecnologia (SCT), Dr. Helio Jaguaribe. O capitulo inicial busca condensar a visao de um grupo multidisciplinar de pesquisadores seniores do INPE sobre as perspectivas das atividades espaciais brasileiras para o final dos anos 90 e inicio do seculo 21. O restante do trabalho baseia-se fortemente no documento "Plano Nacional de Atividades Espaciais: 1993-2005" (PNAE) realizado para a Comissao Brasileira de Atividades Espaciais (COBAE) por um grupo de trabalho do qual participaram ativamente alguns dos autores deste texto. A visao do Panorama Internacional e da Situacao Atual das Atividades Espaciais Brasileiras, aqui apresentadas nos capitulos 2 e 3, procuram atualizar e complementar informacoes similares contidas no referido Plano da COBAE, cujo conteudo programatico Ç condensado no quarto capitulo. Exceto talvez pelo capitulo inicial, a contribuicao mais inovadora deste trabalho encontra-se no quinto e ultimo capitulo. Considerando que o PNAE fora concebido prestando-se pouca atencao a aspectos de realismo orcamentario, o capitulo final propoe-se a realizar a viabilidade economica daquele Plano dentro de um horizonte temporal estendido ate o ano 2010. Para este efeito o trabalho baseia-se em um conjunto de hipoteses consideradas entao bastente plausiveis e fortemente calcadas em politicas globais divulgadas para o setor de Ciencia e Tecnologia, a partir das quais torna-se possivel extrapolar um orcamento que se poderia realisticamente pretender para financiar as atividades espaciais brasileiras ao longo do periodo em pauta.  A principal conclusao dessa analise Ç de que as pretensoes programaticas contidas no PNAE se tornariam economicamente viaveis, em geral, ao se considerar o alongamento de 5 anos no horizonte de planejamento; a excessao seria o Programa de Lancadores de Satelites e Foguetes de Sondagem que, ainda assim, iria requerer recursos financeiros substancialmente superiores aos projetados neste exercicio.

   83:  Este relatorio apresenta uma avaliacao da nova missao do Satelite de Sensoriamento Remoto (SSR) que faz parte da Missao Espacial Completa Brasileira (MECB). As linhas basicas para a nova concepcao do SSR foram apresentadas, por tecnicos do INPE, a empresa alema Dornier a qual submeteu ao INPE uma proposta para o SSR. A principal caracteristica da nova concepcao do SSR e a baixa orbita equatorial, que permite uma alta taxa de aquisicao de imagens, para as regioes Amazonica e Nordeste. A proposta do SSR foi analisada com a finalidade de avaliar a contribuicao das imagens do SSR para o monitoramento ambiental. A partir desta analise foram sugeridas algumas adaptacoes visando aumentar o escopo das aplicacoes das imagens do SSR. O satelite tera uma resolucao temporal de 2horas e obtera imagens, em dias consecutivos, nos mesmos horarios. Ele cobrira uma faixa no solo de mais de 2000 km (5 graus N ate proximo de 15 graus S) obtendo imagens com uma resolucao espacial de 100 metros no nadir e 200 metros na estremidade de imageamento (15 graus S). O sensor do SSR devera dispor de quatro bandas espectrais: a) 0,459 a 0,479 um; b) 0,630 a 0,690 um; c) 0,760 a 0,900 um: e d) 1,55 a 1,75 um. As imagens adquiridas sobre toda a area recoberta deverao ser transmitidas pelo satelite para uma estacao de recepcao centralizada. Alem da transmissao centralizada, o SSR transmitira imagens de forma descentralizada, em tempo real, as estacoes de recepcao de usuarios locais a fim de permitir o monitoramento de processos dinamicos. A alta resolucao temporal do SSR devera permitir a aquisicao de imagens livres de cobertura de nuvens que seja de forma direta ou indireta atraves da composicao de imagens multitemporais. Algumas das principais atividades e fenomenos que poderao ser monitoradas atraves das imagens do SSR sao: desmatamento, areas queimadas, enchentes, caracterizacao da vegetacao, classificacao da vegetacao, regeneracao da vegetacao, fenologia da vegetacao, monitoramento das areas agricolas, desertificacao, radiacao solar, mineracao, e monitoramento de sedimentos e de ecossistemas submarinos

   83:  A busca de melhores leiautes Ç um problema de otimizacao combinatoria que surge em uma grande variedade de contextos de planejamento espacial, como no leiaute de departamentos em uma industria. Como nao existe algoritmo de otimizacao conhecido que obtenha uma solucao otima global em tempo polinomial, usam-se metodos heuristicos. Estudamos o assunto aplicando a seguinte sequencia de passos para um dado problema: 1) Geramos uma solucao inicial atraves do procedimento de aglomeracao; 2) Geramos uma outra solucao inicial, recolocando as facilidades aleatoriamente; 3) Aplicamos a busca tabu as duas solucoes iniciais geradas; 4) Comparamos os resultados obtidos no passo 3. Este procedimento Ç aplicado a quatro casos: os de 12, 15, 20 e 30 facilidades. No espaco destinado a alocacao das facilidades ja existiam areas ocupadas e que nao podiam ser utilizadas pelas facilidades, o que aumentou consideravelmente a dificuldade de tratamento do problema. Comparando os leiautes iniciais produzidos no passo 1 com os produzidos no passo 2, concluimos que o procedimento de aglomeracao gerou leiautes iniciais de melhor qualidade. No passo 4, percebemos que a busca tabu, quando aplicada a solucao inicial produzida pelo passo 1, gera leiautes finais de qualidade ligeiramente superiores aos obtidos, quando este procedimento Ç aplicado a solucao inicial produzida pelo passo 2. Concluimos que independentemente da qualidade da solucao inicial, a busca tabu Ç uma heuristica eficiente no processo de busca.

   83:  Este trabalho tem como objetivo apresentar o resultado das primeiras medidas sistematicas da concentracao de gas carbonico (CO2) atmosferico realizada em diferentes regioes do Brasil e verificar a influencia das queimadas no aumento desta concentracao. O CO2 Ç um gas que tem uma grande importancia nos processos de fotossintese das plantas e respiracao das plantas e animais e tambem no balanco climatico terrestre. Dos gases produzidos por atividades humanas, o CO2 Ç o principal contribuinte para o efeito estufa, contribuindo com mais de 50
   83:   da contribuicao total dos gases do efeito estufa. Sua principal fonte de producao Ç a queima de combustiveis fosseis seguida pela queima de biomassa enquanto os principais sumidouros sao os oceanos e em menor escala a biomassa viva. Usando-se um analisador infravermelho nao dispersivo, foram realizadas medidas de concentracao do CO2 em diferentes regioes do Brasil, principalmente no cerrado da regiao Centro Oeste. Os resultados mostram uma grande variacao duirna da concentracao do CO2, com altas concentracoes durante a noite e madrugada e baixas concentracoes durante o dia, com o minimo ocorrendo entre 11:00 e 15:00 horas. Um outro aspecto verificado foi o aumento da concentracao durante os meses de agosto a outubro, coincidindo com a estacao das secas, onde se verifica um grande numero de focos de queimadas e tambem baixa produtividade primaria. Este fato Ç bastente evidente em Porto Nacional, TO, onde ha um aumento de 20
   83:   da concentracao de CO2 na epoca das queimadas em relacao a epoca das chuvas, onde praticamente nao ha ocorrencia de queimadas. Apresentamos tambem neste trabalho, um modelo teorico para se estimar a emissao de CO2 devido as queimadas baseado em medidas da concentracao de monoxido de carbono (CO) realizadas em Cuiaba (MT) e Natal (RN).

Nesta fase, o principal objetivo Ç otimizar o metodo da observacao e estabelecer a sistematica de analise dos dados usando a tecnica de fotometria rapida com resolucao temporal de 1 ms. As observacoes foram realizadas na direcao dos pulsares PSR 0531+21 e PSR0833-45, presentes no interior dos restos das supernovas do Caranguejo e de Vela, respectivamente. Para tentar a deteccao das pulsacoes destes pulsares, foram feitas analises de espectros de potencias e curvas de correlacao, sendo aplicados aos espectros de potencias testes estatisticos baseados em propriedades da distribuicao X2. Deste modo, foram detectadas pulsacoes com periodo de 33,413208008(+-7) ms vindas do pulsar PSR 0531+21. Entretanto, nenhuma pulsacao foi detectada em PSR0833+45 dentro de um limite de 20,49 magnitudes.

   83:  Um codigo computacional baseado na primeira aproximaáao do metodo de Belotserkovskii foi desenvolvido para o calculo do coeficiente de arrasto de configuraáoes esfera-cone. Neste metodo a regiao de integraáao Ç subdividida em faixas por uma serie de curvas com suas formas determinadas pelos contornos da regiao. Integra-se, atraves destas faixas, o sistema de equaáoes diferenciais parciais governantes com relacao a uma das variaveis independentes e, entao, aproxima-se os integrandos em polinomios de ordem m nesta variavel. Apos a integracao destes polinomios, obtem-se um sistema aproximado de equaáoes diferenciais ordinarias em funáao da variavel independente remanescente. Os resultados obtidos para o coeficiente de pressao e coeficiente de arrasto para as diversas configuracoes sao comparados com os dados experimentais de tuneis de vento.

   83:  The objective of this paper is to study the problem of gravitacional capture in the regularized restricted three-body problem. A gravitacional capture occurs when a massless particle changes its two-body energy around one celestial body from positive to negative without the use of non-gravitacional forces. We studied the importance of several of the parameters involved for a capture in the Earth-Moon system, including the time required for the capture. Then we generalize those results for other binary systems, like the Sun-Earth, Sun-Mars and Sun-Jupiter systems. Next, we cover the whole interval of the mass parameter u ( the mass ratio of the two primaries) and we study the gravitacional capture in the interval 0.0<u<0.5.

   83:  This papers considers the problem of applying an impulsive thrust in a spacecraft that is performing a Swing-By maneuver (also called Gravity Assisted maneuver). The objective is to derive a set of analytical equations that can calculate the change in velocity, energy and angular momentum for this maneuver as a function of the three usual parameters of the standard Swing-By maneuver plus the two parameters that specify the planar impulse applied. The dynamics used to obtain those equations is the one given by the "patched-conic" approach. A study is also performed to find in which cases the impulse is more effiecient when applied during that close approach or after that, in a two steps maneuver. After that, the same maneuvers are computed under the dynamics given by the restricted three-body problem and the results are compared with the ones obtained previously under the "patched-conic" dynamics.

   83:  In this paper we search for transfer orbits from one body back to the same body (Henon's problem, see Henon, 1968) in the Earth-Moon system. It is a continuation of a previous research (Prado and Broucke, 1994; Prado, 1993), where this problem was studied for the Earth-Sun system. In particular, we are searching for orbits that can be used in three situations: a) To transfer a spacecraft from the Moon back to the Moon; b) To transfer a spacecraft from the Moon to the respective Lagragian points L3, L4 and L5; c) to transfer a spacecraft to an orbit the passes close to the Moon and to the Earth, with the goal of building a transportation system between these two celestial bodies. The model used for the dynamics is the planar and circular restricted three-body problem. The global Lamaitre regularization is used to avoid numerical problems during close approaches. An interesting result that was obtained in this research is a family of transfer orbits from the Moon back to the Moon that requires an impulse with magnitude lower than the space velocity from the Moon.

   87:  perturbacaoveiculo espacial
   83:  Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo desenvolver o estudo da perturbacao causada em veiculo espacial por um terceiro corpo envolvido na dinamica. Ela deve ser considerada como continuacao do trabalho do Dr. Roger Broucke intitulado "The double Averaging of the third Body Perturbations". As hipoteses sao similares as que sao formuladas no proble de tres corpos: a) Existem apenas tres corpos envolvidos no sistema: um corpo principal com massa mo fixo na origem do sistema de referencia; um veiculo espacial com massa desprezivel em uma orbita generica em torno do corpo principal e um terceiro corpo em orbita circular em torno do corpo principal no plano xy; b) O movimento do veiculo espacial Ç suposto ser uma orbita Kepleriana tridimensional com os elementos orbitais perturbados por um terceiro corpo. O movimento do veiculo espacial Ç estudado com tres diferentes modelos: i) O modelo de dupla media com a funcao perturbadora expandida ate o Polinomio de Legendre P2[cos(s)]; ii) O modelo de dupla media com a funcao perturbadora expandida ate o Polinomio de Legendre P4[cos(s)]; iii) Problema dos tres corpos em tres dimensoes sem media, sem nenhum truncamento ou aproximacao. Ambos os modelos de dupla media fazem a media sobre o curto periodo do veiculo espacial e o longo periodo do terceiro corpo. Este problema foi estudado anteriormente por pesquisadores como Kozai e Kauffman. A presente pesquisa tem como meta a comparacao do procedimento dos modelos de dupla media com o modelo total e investigar novos detalhes dos modelos de dupla media. Uma das importantes aplicacoes para a presente pesquisa Ç calcular o efeito de perturbacoes lunares e solares sobre satelites terrestres de grande altitude. Ha um interesse especial para ver em que condicoes uma orbita quase circular permanece quase circular. O "angulo critico de perturbacao do terceiro corpo", que Ç um valor para a inclinacao abaixo deste valor permaneca quase circular, sera discutido em detalhes

   83:  In the present paper we study and classify the swing-by maneuvers that use the Moon for the close approach. The goal is to simulate a large variety of initial conditions for those orbits and classify them according to the effects caused by the close approach in the orbit of the spacecraft. Special attention is given to identify the regions where the captures and escapes occur. The classical three parameters (Jacobian constant, pericenter guidance and angle of approach) used to identify a Swing-By maneuver are varied in large intervals to cover a large range of possibilities  for the maneuver. Letter-plots figures are made to show the results obtained in a compact form. The theoretical prediction that for 0.< w < 180. the spacecraft losses energy and for 180.< w < 360. the spacecraft gains energy is confirmed. Regions containing trajectoires that are candidates to generate Belbruno-Miller trajectoires are identified. The well-known planar restricted circular three-body problem is used as the mathematical model. The equations are regularized (using Lamaitre's regularization), so it is possible to avoid the numerical problems that come from the close approach with the Moon

   83:  No periodo de 7 a 10 de julho de 1994, a Regiao Sul do Brasil foi atingida por uma onda de frio que causou geadas intensas e queda de neve em diversos locais. Este evento Ç investigado neste trabalho utilizando-se imagens de satelites meteorologicos, analises de previsao numerica de tempo do "National Meteorological Center"(NMC) dos Estados Unidos da America e dados meteorologicos convencionais. Durante esse periodo ocorreu forte advecáao de ar frio proveniente de latitudes subantarticas na media e baixa troposfera. Alem disso, observou-se a junáao uma baixa fria (media e alta troposfera) com um cavado localizado no Oceano Atlantico Sul. A baixa fria proveniente do Oceano Pacifico Sul, cruzou os Andes seguindo uma trajetoria quase zonal ao longo da latitude seguindo uma trajetoria quase zonal ao longo da latitude 30.S, atingindo o Oceano Atlantico Sudoeste proximo do Uruguai. O cavado amplificou-se para noroeste a partir de latitudes subpolares no Atlantico Sul. A localizacao deste sistema de baixa fria na vizinhanca do sul do Brasil e o estabelecimento de uma bifurcaáao na circulaáao atmosferica no Oceano Pacifico Sudeste permitiram um fluxo de ar frio para norte favorecendo a ocorrencia de geadas e queda de neve em alguns locais. Analise da equaáao de vorticidade quase geostrofica mostra que a advecáao da vorticidade foi responsavel pelo deslocamento da baixa fria para leste. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que a circulaáao subantartica desempenhou um papel importante na sequencia de eventos que precedeu este caso.

   83:  Whenever a dynamical system is amenable to a computacional description a possibility is open for exploring the issue of emergent computations, that is, the relations between the various phase trajectories of the system dynamics and computations. However, this possibility exists only in principle; in practice it is hindered by the architectural features of the system, that constrains the kinds of questions one can ask. Here we conceptualise on a particular subspace of computations that can be used to address issues of emergent computations - such as issues of critically in the space of computable functions - within a class of multi-agent architectures. Although the presentations is made in the context of Enact, a particular artificial life world, the points to be made are not restricted to it. The paper does not involve a running experiment, neither is any particular issue on emergent functions  be addressed herein. Rather, the emphasis is on the identification and analysis of a particular space of computable functions, and on how it comes out of a world set-up for that artificial life world. The suitability of this space for studying emergent computation is characterised by its simple definition, that renders it tractable to formal analysis, and by its richness in terms of the computable functions entailed by it.

   83:  Os dados ionosfericos obtidos por uma digissonda 256, instalada em Cachoeira Paulista, SP(22,5.S, 45.O), foram analisados e comparados com as predicoes feitas por um modelo ionosferico internacional de referencia, denominado IRI (International Reference Ionosphere). Os dados foram obtidos entre 1990 e 1993. Os parametros ionosfericos utilizados para comparacao foram: a densidade maxima da regiao F ionosferica (NmF2), a altura correspondente a maxima densidade (hmF2) e os perfis verticais de densidade (densidade em funcao da altura real, para varios horarios). A analise foi baseada apenas nos cinco dias mais calmos de cada mes, ou seja, apenas nos dias em que a atividade magnetica fosse baixa, isso porque o IRI Ç um modelo medio, o qual nao leva em consideracao as variacoes devidas a perturbacoes magneticas. O periodo analisado abrange parte do maximo, e o inicio da fase decrescente do 22.  ciclo solar, com o numero de manchas solares variando entre 140.3 (abril de 1990) e 21.7 ( setembro de 1993). A analise mostra que os perfis preditos pelo modelo concordam muito bem com as observacoes em torno do meio-dia. Porem, em torno do amanhecer e do anoitecer, o modelo IRI subestima a densidade eletronica da base da camada F. O modelo tambem subestima NmF2 na maioria dos horarios noturnos, para os meses do equinocio e verao, durante alta atividade solar e superestima em qualquer horario, durante baixa atividade solar. As comparacoes aqui feitas mostram que o efeito da anomalia de Appleton nao esta devidamente considerado no modelo, o qual necessita correcoes para representar melhor a ionosfera de latitudes baixas, sobre a regiao brasileira.

Um caso deste tipo de falha Ç a inexistencia de alguns dados da serie sem altracao da frequencia de amostragem. Destes dois, apenas o primeiro sera abordado neste estudo. Tres metodos sao considerados: i)aproximacao multi-escala por linhas quebradas, ou por interpolacao linear; ii) aproximacao por minimo quadrado medio hierarquico; iii) reconstrucao usando Transformada em Ondeletas. Procura-se, neste estudo, de um lado, estabelecer o metodo mais adequado par recuperar dados meteorologicos sujeitos a falha de amostragem citada, e de outro lado, avaliar a possibilidade de aplicacoes da TO a solucao dos dois problemas de amostragem.

   83:  Development of equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) under quiescent and disturbed ionospheric conditions are investigated using the data collected from the low-latitude network of ionosondes and magnetometers operated at different longitude sectors of the globe as a part of the SUNDIAL 86 campaign (22 September to 3 October, 1986). Based on case studies of EIA developments, attention is focused on identifying the EIA response to changes in the electric fields associated with the equatorial electrojet and counter electrojet events. The response time of the EIA to electric field changes is found to vary from 2.5 to 4 h. An anomalous EIA development observed in the morning sector on September 23 suggested possible electric field penetration to low latitude during a substorm energy storage/Dst development phase. The analysis also shows that the afternoon EIA could be inhibited due to equatorward blowing disturbed neutral winds. The results of the present analysis emphasize the need for pursuing further investigations for the response of EIA to magnetosphere-induced disturbances

   83:  This paper examines in detail the electrical coupling between the high-, middle-, and low-latitude ionospheres during January 17-19, 1984, using interplanetary and high-latitude magnetic field data together with F region plasma drift measurements from the EISCAT, Sondre Stromfjord, Millstone Hill, Saint-Santin, Arecibo, and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars. We study the penetration of both the zonal and meridional electric field components of high-latitude origin into the low-latitude and the equatorial ionospheres. In the dusk sector, a large perturbation of the zonal equatorial electric field was observed in the absence of similar changes at low and middle latitudes in the same longitudinal sector. The observations in the postmidnight sector are used to compare the longitudinal variation of the zonal perturbation electric field with predictions made from global convection models. Our results show that the meridional electric field perturbations are considerably more attenuated with decreasing latitude than the zonal fluctuations. As a result, we conclude that variations in the meridional electric field at low latitudes are largely due to dynamo effects. These observations are used to show that the global convection models reproduce a number of characteristics of low-latitude and equatorial electric fields associated with changes in the polar cap potential drop. In addition, we highlight several areas where there is still substancial disagreement between the electric field data and the theoretical results

   83:  Diurnal and nocturnal laser radar measurements of mesospheric sodium density at Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil (23 degrees S, 46 degrees W), show strong oscillations with 12 and 24 hour periods. Data obtained in 1981 showed that atmospheric tides, mainly the vertical wind field, are the major causes of the density variations at a fixed height, thus making it possible to infer vertical wind parameters over a limited height range. In this work, 1984 and 1985 data are added to the earlier 1981 data and the 12- and 24-hour components are determined for different seasons in order to study the seasonal variations of the the tides. It is shown that the amplitudes of the oscillations in sodium density and consequently the vertical wind amplitudes, in general, are larger in winter than in other seasons. Above 97 km, the semidiurnal amplitude is larger than the diurnal in winter, of the same order of magnitude at the equinoxes and smaller in summer. The phases of the inferred semidiurnal vertical wind component, above 97 km, show regular propagating characteristics with little differences between winter and equinoxes, but a confused pattern in summer. Below 93 km the wavelenghts decrease from winter to summer. In all seasons, the phase of the inferred diurnal vertical wind component stays at around 19-23 h below 85 km and above 93 km. The behavior of the phase of the diurnal oscillation in sodium density between 85 amd 90 km is quite different in the three seasons. This is explained by seasonal differences in the relative phases of the oscillations in vertical wind and density

   83:  KIRKWOOD and COLLIS (1989) have suggested that the sudden sodium layers (SSLs) which have been observed at high latitudes (von ZAHN et al., 1987; von ZAHN and HANSEN, 1988; GARDNER et al., 1986) might be produced by strong downward neutral winds, probably produced by gravity waves resulting from Joule heating caused by auroral precipitation. They show that the presence of such a wind could produce enhanced concentrations of minor atmospheric constituents provided two conditions were met: (1) the vertical wind would have to decrease rapidly with decreasing height (in Kirkwood and Collis's model it was reduced to zero just below the height at which the layer was to be formed), and (2) the mixing ratio of the minor constituent would have to increase with height above this point. The suggestion of Kirkwood and Collis is an interesting one, especially in view of the fact that the alternative mechanisms which have been suggested in the literature (CLEMESHA et al., 1978, 1980; von ZAHN et al., 1987; CLEMESHA et al., 1988) have not been shown to explain all the observed characteristics of enhanced sodium layers. Unfortunately, however, there appear to be two fatal flaws in the proposed mechanism

The annual mean temperatures are found to be 193 K and 198 K for the OH and O2 emissions, respectively. The OH rotational temperature shows an annual oscillation of 2.3 K amplitude with a maximum in late March, and the semiannual component shows equinoctial maxima with an amplitude of 3.0 K. The O2-derived temperature shows a 2.5 K annual component maximizing in May

   83:  In a recent paper, Newman [1988] has presented Na D airglow profiles obtained by a limb-scanning instrument aboard one of the DMSP satellites. These profiles show a number of surprising features. The unexpected characteristics of the satellites measurements are (1) surprisingly high intensities at the equator, as compared with midnorthern latitudes; (2) topside scale heights for the emission intensity as large as 16 km; and (3) peak emission heights as low as 75 km.

   83:  The southern polar ionospheric research is very important not only because it is less favoured by the number of observing sites than its counterpart in the northern hemisphere, but also because there exist important hemispheric asymmetries mainly caused by the eccentricity of the equivalent geomagnetic dipole. For instance, because of the greater offset of the geomagnetic pole from the geographic pole, the longitudinal changes are more noticeable in the southern ionosphere (Rees and Fuller-Rowell, 1987)

   83:  Simultaneous measurements of the 02(0,1) atmospheric band (864.5 nm) and OH(9,4) band (774,6 nm) emissions in the night airglow, using a tilting filter photometer, have been carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 deg. S, 45.0 deg W), Brazil, since 1983. The band intensities of the 02(0,1) band, I(02) and OH(9,4) band, I(OH), and their rotational temperatures, T(02) and T(OH) have been obtained. In the nocturnal variations time-lagged wave-like co-variations between the intensities  and rotational temperatures were frequently observed. Correlation studies reveal that, in general, the rotational temperature variations, T(02) and T(OH), lead the intensity variations, I(02) and I(OH), respectively. It is found that the time lag between T(02) and T(OH) is less, by about 0.5 hour, than that between I(02) and I(OH), which is about 1.5 hours, indicating that the airglow intensity response to atmospheric wave propagation is different from the temperature response

   83:  In situ measurement of electron density height profile of the equatorial nightime ionosphere, under a developing spread F event, was carried out using a dual mode high frequency capacitance (HFC) probe that was flown on board a SONDA-III rocket launched from Natal on December, 11, 1985. This represents the first measurement of plasma bubble characteristics using an HFC probe. A series of plasma bubbles in varying degrees of their growth phase was detected mostly during the upleg of the flight. A somewhat detailed discussion, and comparative studies, of the measurements at the two probe frequencies (6.17 MHz and 11.75 MHz) are presented in this paper. Among the important findings from the present study is an evidence of electron temperature enhancement in the plasma bubble possibly caused by electron heating from energetic particle precipitation in the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly

   83:  The Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) development can undergo drastic modification in the form of an anomalous occurrence at local times outside that of its quiet time development and/or inhibition/enhancement at local times of its normal occurences. This happens for disturbed electrodynamic conditions of the global ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere system, consequent upon the triggering of a magnetospheric storm event. Direct penetration to equatorial latitudes of the magnetospheric electric fields and the thermopheric disturbances involving winds, electric fields and composition changes produce significant alteration in the EIA morphology and dynamics. Results on statistical behaviour based on accumulated ground-based data sets, and those from recent theoretical modelling efforts and from satellite and ground-based observations, are reviewed. Some outstanding problems of the EIA response to magnetopheric disturbances that deserve attention in the coming years are pointed out

   83:  O perfil de altura real da ionosfera obtido a partir de ionogramas e uma ferramenta muito util para os estudos ionosfericos. Neste trabalho faz-se uma comparacao entre os perfis deduzidos usando dois metodos: POLAN e Digissonda. O POLAN e o metodo polinomial de calculo de altura real que tem sido mais usado recentemente pela comunidade cientifica, para fins de compatibilidade dos resultados. A Digissonda tambem calcula a altura real usando um metodo polinomial. A vantagem da Digissonda e que a tarefa de conversao do ionograma em perfil de altura real e bem mais simples uma vez que os dados ja estao em forma digital e prontos para serem processados. Foi observado que, para a maioria dos casos analisados no periodo marco/abril de 1990, ha uma boa concordancia entre os perfis obtidos pelos dois metodos e que, em media, os perfis da Digissonda podem ser usados para os mesmos estudos nos quais o POLAN tem sido usado. Apesar de que algumas discrepancias tenham sido observadas elas sao previsiveis (ocorrem quando a densidade eletronica da regiao F, a noite, esta muito acima dos valores medios para periodos magneticamente calmos), portanto nao invalidariam o uso dos perfis deduzidos pela Digissonda, perante o POLAN. No entanto, e necessaria uma revisao dos dois metodos para que a causa dessas discrepancias seja corrigida

   83:  We have carried out and intercomparison of the layer height parameters hmF2, hpF2 and hpF2[M(3000)] all deduced from h'(f) curve, in order to identify the conditions and trends, if any, under which the hmF2, according to the POLAN true height analysis could be best represented by either of the other two parameters that are obtained empirically from simple considerations. The analysis is carried out for a low-latitude and an equatorial station, for two different months, representative of local summer and equinox. The analysis shows that during nighttime hpF2 and hmF2[M(3000)] are almost coincident and both of them give a very good estimation of hmF2 (according to the POLAN code), implying that either of them could be used to represent the F2 layer peak height within the same precision. During daytime, however, hpF2 is generally higher than hmF2[M(3000)], the difference being more pronounced during December (local summer) months. It is observed that during daytime hmF2[M(3000)] overestimates hmF2 (derived using POLAN) over the equatorial station and underestimates it over the low-latitude station, while hpF2 generally overestimates it at both locations

   83:  The great geomagnetic storm of March 13, 1989 (E Kp=60, Ap=246) caused severely anomalous behavior in the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere in the Brazilian longitude sector. The ionograms over Fortaleza (4 degrees S, 38 degrees W) indicated F region upward plasma drifts exceeding 200 m s-1 at 1830 LT as compared to normal values of 40 m s-1 for this epoch. Large negative phases were observed in foF2 over Fortaleza and Cachoeira Paulista (22.5 degrees S, 45 degrees W) and in total electron content measured over Sao Jose dos Campos (23 degrees S, 46 degrees W). The equatorial ionization anomaly was totally absent either because of its anomalous expansion to higher latitudes or because of inhibition of its development on the two nights following the storm. Many anomalous variations in F region peak density and height, occurring simultaneously with sharp variations on H component of magnetic field over Fortaleza and with auroral substorms, give strong evidence of penetration of magnetospheric electric fields to equatorial and low latitudes. Auroral type sporadic E and night E layers are observed after 1830 LT over Cachoeira Paulista, the latter showing peak electron density about 6 x 10-4  el cm-3, therefore comparable to the E layer peak density in the morning hours at that station. The Fortaleza ionograms show the presence of the F1 layer at night, a phenomenon that has never been observed over our two stations before. The role played by electric fiels penetrating from high to low latitudes, particle precipitation, and composition changes in explaining the observations is discussed

   83:  During 1979 and 1980 the INPE lidar located at Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil was operated in a steerable mode, measuring the sodium profiles sequentially at three points in the sky. Twelve sporadic sodium layer events (SSLs) which occurred in this period are studied in the present work. The evolution of the sporadic peaks at the three positions shows short time structures generally separated by consistent time lags in almost all events. On some occasions, the time evolution at one position is very different than at the other two. These data indicate that short duration SSLs have cloud-like structures which are advected over the measuring station by the horizontal winds, and the long duration layers show a patchy and wave-like structure. In no case did we observe rapid growth in the sodium density to occur simultaneously at all 3 measuring points. On this basis we believe that there is no evidence for fast production of sodium, and consequently that there is no need for theories for the formation of SSLs to be consistent with such fast production

   83:  During a period of high solar activity (1979/1980), IRI-predicted electron density profiles were compared with measurements made at Fortaleza (Brazil), 2 degrees off the dip equator. A few discrepancies were found. They are attributed mainly to dynamical effects associated with the low latitude E x B electromagnetic plasma drifts and thermospheric neutral winds that are not correctly reproduced in the CCIR numerical maps and in the IRI profile shapes as well. In particular, the dependence on the magnetic declination angle, which strongly affects the electrodynamical plasma motions at low latitudes, is not satisfactorily considered in the models

   83:  Simultaneous measurements of the atomic oxygen nightglow emissions at 777.4 nm and 630.0 nm have been used in the past few years to determine the ionospheric F-layer peak electron density and peak height, and to investigate the pattern of F-layer depleted plasma regions, or ionospheric transequatorial plasma bubbles, and their associated irregularities in the tropical ionosphere. Meridional scanning observations of these emissions at low latitudes, made with groundbased filter photometers, are presented in the form of computer generated three-dimensional perspective views, showing the spatial north-south and temporal intensity variatons of these OI emissions, for both normal conditions and in the presence of magnetic field-aligned large scale plasma irregularities or bubbles. The significant features of these observations are discussed. This remote sensing airglow technique shows to be very useful to study ionospheric plasma dynamical processes and to investigate the pattern and time evolution of large scale plasma irregularities in the nightime tropical ionosphere

   83:  Simultanoeus observations of permitted and forbidden atomic oxygen airglow emissions have been used in the past by several investigators to study nighttime dynamical processes in the low-latitude F-region ionospheric plasma. Simultaneous measurements of the emissions OI 135.6 nm (or OI 777.4 nm) and OI 630.0 nm, either from satellite or from ground-based instrumentation, can be used to infer the F-region peak electron density, nm(e), and height, hm. Results are presented showing the use of this remote sensing technique to study low-latitude ionospheric dynamical processes, including mapping of F-region plasma irregularities and transequatorial plasma bubbles, ionospheric effetcs due to thermospheric neutral winds and ionospheric response during magnetically disturbed conditions

After removing seasonal and long-term variations, the closest correlation is observed between the OH(9,4) emission intensity and the corresponding rotational temperature, followed by the NaD, and the OI 557.7 nm and O2A emissions. The regression coefficients, (dI/I)/(dT/T), where I is intensity and T is temperature, are between 8 and 9 for the NaD and oxygen emissions, and about 5.5 for the OH band. It is clear that these regression coefficients do not reflect the temperature dependences of the various reactions involved. It seems probable that the observed correlations are the result of correlated temperature and density changes in the upper atmosphere

   83:  E-region electric fields estimated from VHF radar observation of the phase velocity of plasma irregularities and the strength of overhead currents estimated from ground level geomagnetic field measurements at two equatorial stations, Jicamarca, Peru and Thumba, India are compared. The overhead currents in the equatorial regions are driven by electric fields mapped from nonequatorial latitudes, where they are generated by the dynamo action. The geomagnetic declination angle at a given place thus plays an important role in determining the daytime variation of electric fields in the equatorial E-region, which in turn influences the vertical distribution of the overhead currents. The geomagnetic declination angle at Jicamarca being much larger than at Thumba, the present comparative study clearly brings out the role of geomagnetic declination angle in determining the vertical distribution of daytime currents in the equatorial E-region

   83:  Night-time ionospheric plasma density profiles over the equatorial station Natal, Brazil measured simultaneously using a rocket-borne Langmuir Probe (LP) and a High Frequency Capacitance Probe (HFC) on two occasions, show considerable differences, especially above the F-region peak. In this height region, the electron density values estimated from the LP ion currents are considerably less than those estimated from the HFC data, while below the F-region peak, the LP electron densities seem to be slightly greater than the HFC electron densities. From considerations of the basic principles of the two experiments it is seen that while the higher LP electron densities at lower heights are probably due to an increase in the effective sensor surface area caused by the sheath formation, in the region above the F-peak the relative lower plasma density obtained from LP current seems to be caused by (a) change in the floating potential of the rocket, (b) a decrease in the thickness of the plasma sheath, and (c) an increase in the mean ion thermal velocity relative to the rocket velocity

   83:  The seasonal averages of the equatorial F region vertical and zonal plasma drifts are determined using extensive incoherent scatter radar observations from Jicamarca during 1968-1988. The late afternoon and nighttime vertical and zonal drifts are strongly dependent on the 10.7-cm solar flux. We show that the evening preversal enhancement of vertical drifts increases linearly with solar flux during equinox but tends to saturate for large fluxes during southern hemisphere winter. We examine in detail, for the first time, the seasonal variaton of the zonal plasma drifts and their dependence on solar flux and magnetic activity. The seasonal effects on the zonal drifts are most pronounced in the midnight-morning sector. The nighttime eastward drifts increase with solar flux for all seasons but decrease slightly with magnetic activity. The daytime westward drifts are essentially independent of season, solar cycle, and magnetic activity

   83:  Using a new mode of scanning 630-nm photometer operation the zonal velocities of ionospheric plasma depletions were measured over Cachoeira Paulista in Brasil in two east-west planes tilted 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S with respect to zenith. The measurements cover a time period of approximately 2 years, from January 1988 to January 1990, a period marked by significant increase in solar activity of the ongoing cycle. The results have permitted a rather detailed evaluation of the local time and latitude variations in the zonal plasma bubble velocity as a function of solar activity. Although the mean trend in the velocity local time variation is a decrease from early evening to post-midnight hours, a strong tendency for velocity peak is observed near 21 LT and midnight. The velocities as well as their height (latitude) gradients show perceivable increases with solar activity represented as sunspot numbers. The present results are compared with the ambient plasma velocities measured using the Jicamarca radar by Fejer et al. (1985) J. Geophys. Res.90,12249, with that measured on board the DE 2 satellite on the equatorial latitudes by Coley and Heelis (1989), J. Geophys. Res.94, 6751, and with various theoretical calculations, in an attempt to bring out the salient features of the plasma dynamics of the equatorial ionosphere

As medidas de O2 e OH sao usadas para estudar as temperaturas rotacionais TO2 e TOH, respectivamente. As variacoes temporais das intensidades e das temperaturas rotacionais constituem uma importante tecnica para estudar a fotoquimica e a dinamica da mesosfera; uma analise de correlacao cruzada entre as intensidades e as temperaturas rotacionais nos permite avaliar a resposta dos constituintes minoritarios (O, Na e OH) quando a mesosfera e perturbada. Os dados analisados correspondem ao periodo de janeiro/87 a janeiro/88, e pode-se verificar que as temperaturas rotacionais respondem mais rapido que as emissoes a passagem de uma perturbacao

   83:  The ionosphere - Thermosphere system of the earth's equatorial region Is governed by coupling processes peculiar to this region arising basically from the low inclination of the geomagnetic field coupled with the relatively larger fraction of the solar radient energy absorbed in the tropical latitudes. The major objective of the project EITS (of STEP/WG.3) is to study In detail the coupling processes of the system (a) under quiet conditions and (b) under EITS responses to solar wind - magnetosphere-high latitude ionosphere - thermosphere disturbances triggered by solar events, and to forcing from other atmospheric domains. the major phenomena of the EITS: the equatorial ionization anomaly -EIA (and the associated anomalies in wind, temperature and neutral densities), the equatorial spread F Irregularity processes - ESF, and the electrojet current system - EEJ, as well as the equatorial electric field and neutral winds are being Investigated using ground-based low latitude networks of radio, radar and optical Instruments by measurements conducted on board satellite and In rocket campaigns, and using theoretical/modelling studies on the coupling processes. The present overview will focus on recent results from EITS studies with specific focus on: coupling processes under quiet and disturbed conditions, equatorial electric fields based on measurements on plasma drift velocities and ESF,spread F plasma instability processes, neutral wind measurements, and longitudinal characteristics of disturbance penetration electric fields. Some outstanding problem to be focused using the data sets from the series of EITS campaigns being organized are also presented

   83:  This article reviews the major processes governing the Equatorial Ionosphere-Thermosphere System (EITS) response to forcing from magnetospheric disturbances. Some outstanding disturbance features of the EITS in response to specific cases of magnetospheric electric field penetration and storm induced high latitude thermospheric disturbance propagation to equatorial latitudes are discussed, based mostly on recently available satellite measurements. The discussion, complemented by results from ground based observations as well, focusses attention on the prospect of the EITS being a final sink in the solar-interplanetary-magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction chain. Some outstanding problems relating to such response processes to be pursued for further investigation by satellites in the future are also pointed out

   83:  Range spread F (RSF) data for a 12-year period (1978-1990) over the Brazilian low-latitude station, Cachoeira Paulista, are analyzed to determine the fine structure of the seasonal pattern of the irregularity occurrence, which appears consistent throughout an entire solar cycle. The RSF occurrence for one of these years is compared also with that over the equatorial station, Fortaleza, to show that the seasonal pattern discussed here corresponds to that of plasma bubble irregularity developments. A striking result that has come out of the present analysis concerns two secondary minima, during the epoch of broad annual maximum, in the RSF that occur in association with the two nodal points at the magnetically conjugate E layer sunset local times, that is, at the perfect alignment of the sunset terminator with the magnetic meridian of the station. The occurrence of these minima, seen in individual solar minimum and solar maximum years (as also in the overall mean behavior), is interpreted on the basis of a simplified F region dynamo development model that considers also asymmetric conjugate E layer decay conditions. Competing roles of a prereversal zonal electric field enhancement and of its height gradient seem to determine the occurrences of these secondary minima in RSF

   83:  A review is provided of some of the major interactons in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, with emphasis on those internal interactions involving mutual coupling between neutral winds, plasma drifts, and the F2-layer peak height. Examples of parameterizations for interactions of this type at low, middle, and high latitudes, intended for use in numerical predictions, are presented. A new parameterization for hmF2 in terms of wind- and electric field-driven drifts at equatorial latitudes is given, and verifications of the accuracy of previously developed parameterizations at middle and high lalitudes are provided

   83:  Measurements of ionospheric F-region peak electron densities, peak heights and atomic oxygen 630 nm airglow emission column intensities, carried out at a low-latitude station located at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45 degrees W; dip latitude 11,9 degrees S), in Brazil, are analysed and compared with the ionospheric parameters predicted by the SLIM and by the IRI ionospheric models. The MSIS neutral atmosphere model is used with the IRI model to calculate the 630 nm nightglow emission intensities. This comparative analysis considers data representative of the summer, winter and equinox seasons, obtained during the high solar activity period around 1980. Reasonably good agreement is obtained between the local time variations of the ionospheric and airglow data, and the IRI model predicted parameter variations, but the SLIM model overestimates the F-region peak heights especially during the late afternoon and nightime hours. These height discrepancies are explained in terms of the strong logitudinal dependence of the electromagnetic E x B vertical plasma drifts and thermospheric neutral winds, which greatly influences the dynamics of the low-latitude ionospheric plasma and airglow emissions. Due to the importance of the relative alignement condition between terminator and magnetic meridian, with its longitudinal and seasonal dependence, on the vertical plasma drifts around sunset, it is suggested that the slim ionospheric model should separately consider the longitudinal zones of positive, negative or zero magnetic declination

   83:  During the 3-4 December 1988 SUNDIAL campaign, coordinated ionospheric measurements were conducted using the low latitude networks of ionosondes and magnetometers distributed at different longitude sectors of the globe and the Jicamarca radar. The results for the American longitude sector are analysed here to examine outstanding features of the sunset F-region electric field developments at Jicamarca and at the Brazilian stations, Fortaleza and Cachoeira Paulista, during the 8-day interval that represented predominantly quiet (except 3 and 11 December that were weakly disturbed) geomagnetic conditions. A comparative study, carried out for the first time, on the simultaneous measurements of F-region plasma vertical drift velocity by Jicamarca radar and the equivalent drift velocity measured by Fortaleza ionosonde testifies the existence, previously known, of the large difference in the evening prereversal electric field development at the two locations. Further, comparison of simultaneous vertical drifts over Fortaleza and over Cachoeira Paulista points to the existence of a height gradient in the zonal evening electric field for the near-solar maximum condition of this campaign measurements. A physical explanation for these effects is attempted using a simplified model of the equatorial evening electric field development processes that considers also asymmetric conjugate E layer sunset decay conditions

   83:  If the final loss of atmosphere sodium occurs in the same height range as its initial entry to the atmosphere, then vertical transport will have little influence on the total abundance of sodium although it could affect its vertical distribution. If, on the other hand, as suggested by a number of recent models, the final sink for sodium is situated well below the layer, and the sodium density depends on a chemical quasi-equilibrium between free sodium and sodium compounds, then the sodium density will be aproximately inversely proportional to the eddy diffusion coefficient. An examination of the experimental evidence suggests that the eddy diffusion does not play an important role in controlling the total abundance of sodium, thus suggesting that the final loss of sodium must occur in the same height region as its initial input

   83:  On the basis of a long series of lidar measurements made at Sao Jose dos Campos, it is found that the centroid height of the atmospheric sodium layer is about 1 km lower in November than during the rest of the year. Photometric measurements of the OH(9,4) and OI 557.7 nm airglow intensities, observed at a nearby location, show that these emissions have maximum values at this time of the year. The hydroxyl emission shows a sharp increase in intensity by about 20
   83:   in November, and the atomic oxygen emission has a broader peak in October, November, and December. There is a strong inverse correlation between the seasonal variations in sodium layer centroid height and the OH intensity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 and a regression coefficient of -89+-16 Rayleighs km-1. It is suggested that the anticorrelated variations in sodium layer height and airglow intensity could be the result of seasonal changes in convective transport in the lower thermosphere

   83:  Simultaneous in-situ measurements of electron densities were made by rocket-borne Langmuir and High Frequency Capacitance probes from the equatorial station Natal in Brazil, using Brazilian SONDA III rockets. On both occasions, the rockets carrying a swept voltage Langmuir probe and a dual frequency High Frequency Capacitance probe, in addition to other experiments, were launched into the nighttime ionosphere. During the first launch the rocket passed through developing plasma bubbles and during the second launch it passed through a practically bubbleless F-region. Electron density irregularities of vertical scale sizes ranging from a few kilometers to as large as 40 to 50 kilometers were observed by both probes. The general features of the large scale structures as observed by the two probes were similar, but there existed also considerable differences. For instance, the amplitudes of small scale structures in the F-region as observed at one of the HFC frequencies were generally larger then those measured by the LP. Experimental factors as well as physical processes responsible for these differences are discussed

   83:  The quantum yields f('D) and f('S) of the atomic oxygen excited states O('D) and O('S), respectively from dissociative recombination in the nocturnal F-region are determined utilizing rocket airglow (OI 630 nm and OI 557.7 nm) and electron density data obtained in two experiments that were carried out at Natal (geogr. 5.8 S, 35.2 W), Brazil, on 11 December 1985 and 31 October 1986. Using the 557.7 and 630 nm airglow data from the second experiment Takahashi et al. (1990, Planet. Space Sci. 38. 547) calculated the ratio f('S)/f('D). From a different approach we utilize in this paper the airglow volumetric emission rate and electron density to calculate f('S) and f('D), individually, which are compared with the previously published results from in situ and laboratory measurements. Our results show f('S) to be height dependent. In the second experiment it varied from 1,96 x 10-2 at 190 km to 1,33 x 10-1 at 315 km with an average value of 0,053. The average value for the first experiment was 0,041. The f('D) magnitude was also found to vary significantly with altitude, its value increasing both upwards and downwards from 250 km where it attains a minimum of about 0.77

   83:  The quenching rate k7 of the O(1D) by O(3P) in the nocturnal F region is evaluated on the basis of rocket-borne photometric and electron density measurements that have been carried out aboard a Brazilian Sonda III rocket launched from Natal (geography 5.8 degrees S, 35.2 degrees W) on October 31, 1986 at 2259 Local Standard Time (LST). The nightglow emission and electron density vertical profiles were obtained respectively from  630-nm photometer and a high-frequency capacitance probe. The quenching rate k7 was evaluated from model calculations of the OI 630-nm emission rate, utilizing as input data the measured electron density. Assuming the value of 1.1 for the quantum yield factor f(1D) a mean value estimated for k7 turned out to be 9.2x10-13 cm3 s-1, the upper and lower limits being 2.8x10-12 cm3 s-1 and zero, respectively. On the other hand, assuming Bates'[1990] height profile of Franck-Condon f(1D) for this same experiment, k7 resulted in 2.55x10-12 cm3 s-1. These results are discussed and compared with previous measurements from other authors

   83:  Simultaneous measurements of the night airglow O2 atmospheric (0,1) band (864.5 nm) and OH(9.4) band (774.6 nm) emissions have been carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W) since 1983. We present a study of gravity wave induced variations in the emission intensities and rotational temperatures. For both the emissions, the intensity variations are normally delayed with respect to the temperature variations, and the phase difference is larger for OH(9,4) than for O2(0,1). The ratio between the amplitudes of fluctuation of the intensity and temperature, expressed as n=(deltaI/I)/(deltaT/T) has been calculated for both the emissions. The mean value of eta for OH(9,4) was 4.9 with a range of 1.03 to 7.9, in agreement with a recent model. For the O2A(0,1) band, varied from 3.4 to 16.1, with a mean of 7.1. The relation between eta and the fluctuation period is also different for the two emissions

The seasonal dependence of the intensity variations of these emissions was studied using the data from a total of 560 nights, during the period June 1977 to November 1986. Strong semiannual variations in the NaD and OI557.7 nm emissions were observed with maxima at the equinoxes, in contrast to the OH(9,4) emission, which showed a much smaller seasonal variation. Hydrogen and ozone concentrations at around 87-89 km were calculated using the observed NaD and OH(9,4) band intensities and the sodium concentration observed by lidar at a nearby station. The obtained seasonal variations of the two species, opposite in phase with each other, are in good agreement with current atmospheric dynamics models, which show a seasonal variation of the vertical transport of atomic oxygen and hydrogen

After making allowance for the sampling effects of the mean seasonal and diurnal variations in centroid height, it is found that the height of the layer fell by approximately 700 meters between 1972 and 1987. A regression analysis indicates a mean rate of fall of 49 +-12 m yr-1, with a correlation coefficient of -0.33, significant at the 99,99

   83:  This article briefly reviews our current understanding of the plasma irregularity processes of the nighttime equatorial ionosphere-thermosphere system (EITS), the composite effects of which on their different diagnostic techniques produce the phenomenon  widely known as the equatorial spread-F(ESF). The morphology of this phenomenon, in terms of the spatial structure, and the diurnal, seasonal and longitudinal distributions of the irregularities, is discussed in some detail. The basic mechanism for the generation of these irregularities, with respect to the development  of large scale structures by primary instability processes, is focused to examine the ambient EITS conditions that favour or inhibit their development. A brief update is given on our existing knowledge on these ambient conditions specially on the thermospheric winds, electric fields and conductivities that govern the sunset electrodynamic processes responsible for the quiettime spread F development. The competing role of zonal wind versus that of meridional wind in the instability development and inhibition processes is discussed in some detail, and the importance of these competing roles on the day-to-day variability in the ESP occurrence, a problem of great current interest, is pointed out

   83:  Sporadic E layer occurrences over the equatorial station Fortaleza are analysed for a 15-year period, from 1975 to 1990. The secular drift of the magnetic equator and hence that of the equatorial electrojet current (EEJ) northward of Fortaleza has resulted in marked long terms changes in the occurrence characteristics of the different types of Es layers: q,l,f,c and h types. Systematic decrease in the occurrence rates of the q-type Es, accompanied with increases in the remaining types of Es, was registered from 1975 to 1990, during which period the magnetic equator drifted northward of Fortaleza by 400km. The overall results show competing roles of the equatorial zonal electric field and winds systems, as well as their long term changes, in the generation of the different types of Es layers at the central region and at the flanks of the EEJ. The F10.7cm radio flux variation during the solar cycle seems to control both the electric field and E region winds of the equatorial region

   83:  Elevated electron temperature regions detected first by KYOKKO Satellite in 1978 and later, more extensively, during the 17-month observational period by HINOTORI Satellite are found to be closely associated with the ionizaton crests of the equatorial anomaly (EIA), also known as Appleton anomaly. This phenomenon which we call equatorial electron temperature anomaly (EETA) occur predominantly in the equinoctial months of March-April and September-October. The elevated electron temperature is found to get enhanced during high solar radio (F10.7 cm) flux. It is  a predominantly nightime phenomenon and shows maximum amplitude around 21 LT. We present a mechanism for its occurrence that is based on the plasma transport pattern of the evening equatorial ionosphere resulting from the sunset electrodynamic processes

   83:  Equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) responses to magnetospheric disturbances have been investigated using ionosonde and geomagnetic data sets obtained for different longitude sectors during the 9-day (28 May-7 June) globally-coordinated SUNDIAL 87 campaign. Attention is focused on the EIA response features of the two magnetically most-disturbed days of the campaign window, 29 May and 6 June. Anomalous EIA inhibition and development were simultaneously observed at widely separated (American and Asia) longitude sectors, accompanied respectively by events of morning electrojet reversal and evening partial ring current development. A numerical model of the low-latitude ionosphere has been used to quantify the role that a disturbance electric fiel could play in the observed EIA response features. The implications of the results on the global low-latitude disturbance electric field pattern is discussed

   83:  We report on the SUNDIAL campaign conducted during the solstitial period May 29-June 7, 1987. For generally quiet conditions a global network of ionosonde data, supported by topside sounder observations of the Intercosmos 1806 satellite, were compared with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). The comparisons included F-region peak characteristics NmF2(i.e., foF2) and hmF2, as well as topside height profiles Ne(z). Overall, the IRI specification of foF2 was found to be higher than the observations. The difference in the daytime hemispheres was nearly twice that in the night-time hemispheres, with no obvious bias in universal time nor in phenomenological domains (e.g., equatorial anomaly, mid-to-high latitudes, etc.). With regard to hmF2 and topside profiles, a small data sample shows relatively good agreement with the IRI. In the topside Ne(z) comparisons there was good qualitative agreement in shape; but there were quantitative differences resulting from differences in NmF2. To improve IRI specifications at high latitudes comparisons also included Feldstein, DMSP, and NOAA/TIROS auroral oval models and their relative agreements with satellite-borne particle measurements of oval boundaries. The NOAA/TIROS model demonstrates the largest range in dynamic oval boundary responses to magnetic activity. It was also found to be in the best agreement with observations and appears to offer highest promise for a proper high-latitude adjunct to the IRI and an improved empirical specification of ionospheric distributions in auroral zones

   83:  Since 1985 the Brazilian National Space Research Institute (INPE), together with the Aeronautics and Space Institute (IAE), has carried out a number of rocket experiments aimed at measuring mesospheric and thermospheric airglow emissions. The photometer payloads have been launched from the Barreira do Inferno, Natal (6 degrees S, 35 degrees W) and Alcantara (2 degrees S, 44 degrees W) launch sites, on SONDA II and SONDA III rockets. The emissions measured in these experiments were O2 275 nm, OI 557.7 nm, Na D 589 nm, OI 630 nm, O2 761.9 nm, and OH (8,3) 742.2 nm. The results of these experiments together with simultaneous ground-based measurements by photometers, lidar, and ionospheric sounding, have been used to study excitation mechanisms and minor constituent concentrations in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This article presents a brief review of the published results of these studies

   83:  On May 31, 1992, a rocket payload equipped with 10 airglow photometers was launched from the Alcantara Launch Center in Northern Brazil. The payload was designed to measure sodium, hydroxyl, atomic and molecular oxygen airglow emissions, in addition to electron density and temperature. At the time of launch, a sodium lidar was operated at the same site, giving vertical profiles of atmospheric sodium density. The measured vertical profiles of the Na D line emission and atomic sodium density are remarkably similar, with sharp boundaries at 81 km and 99 km. On the assumption that the Chapman mechanism is responsible for the Na D emission, the measurements imply an almost constant ozone density of 4 x 10 7 cm-3 between 87 and 99 km. The unexpectedness of this height independent ozone concentration suggests that our understanding of the sodium excitation mechanism might be inadequate

Generally there is a positive correlation for all parameters with F10.7 at a high significance level. The series are also divided in the west and east phase of QBO oscillation in the tropical stratosphere and no significant effect is found. This positive correlation agrees with many previous studies, but the temperature dependence disagrees with recent results obtained between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N

The data were divided into summer, equinox and winter. During the analysed period F10.7 varied from 66 up to 330. Our data shows that the observed TEC at 1600 LT (around the diurnal maximum) and at 0500 LT (around the diurnal minimum) increases with f10.7 until saturation is reached which occurs at F10.7210 to 220 for equinox and summer, and at f10.7180 for winter months. Comparison with the IRI90 predictions shows that IRI overestimates the TEC at 0500 LT for all solar flux values. At 1600 LT, IRI overestimates the observed TEC for low solar flux but underestimates it for high solar flux values

   83:  Measurements of ionospheric electron density vertical profiles, carried out at a magnetic equatorial station located at Fortaleza (4 degrees S, 38 degrees W; dip latitude 2 degrees S) in Brazil, are analysed and compared with low-latitude electron density profiles predicted by the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. The analysis performed here covers periods of high (1979/1980) and low (1986) solar activities considering data obtained under magnetically quiet conditions representative of the summer, winter and equinox seasons. Some discrepancies are found to exist between the observed and the IRI model-predicted ionospheric electron density profiles. For high solar activity conditions the most remarkable one is the observed fast upward motion of the F-layer just after sunset, not considered in the IRI model, and which precedes the occurrence of nighttime ionospheric plasma irregularities. These discrepancies are attributed mainly to dynamical effects associated with the low latitude E x B electromagnetic plasma drifts and the thermospheric neutral winds, which are not satisfactorily reproduced either in the CCIR numerical maps or in the IRI profile shapes. In particular, the pre-reversal enhancement in the vertical E x B plasma drifts around sunset hours has a great influence on the nightime spatial distribution of the low-tatitude ionospheric plasma. Also, the dynamical control exerted by the electromagnetic plasma drifts and by the thermospheric neutral winds on the low-latitude ionospheric plasma is strongly dependent on the magnetic declination angle at a given longitude. These important longitudinal and latitudinal dependences must be considered for improvement of IRI model predictions at low latitudes

   83:  Upper mesospheric temperature at around 87km have been observed by measuring the rotational temperature of the airglow OH(9,4) band emission at two ground-base locations, one in the equatorial region, Fortaleza (3.9 degrees S, 38.4 degrees W) and the other at low latitude, Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W). The data obtained from 1987 to 1991, which includes the DYANA Campaign period, show predominantly semi-annual oscillations at both the locations with maxima at the equinoxes and minima during solistices. The seasonal variation in the equatorial region is, however, much larger (18K peak to peak) than at low latitudes, where it is around 8K, peak to peak. These results agree fairly well with the SME satellite data, but do not agree with model atmospheres presently available. It is suggested that the seasonal effect in vertical turbulent mixing is stronger in the equatorial regional than at low to middle latitudes

The first of them is being designed to carry out about ten ionospheric, thermospheric, magnetospheric and astrophysical experiments. Its orbit will be circular, inclined 25 degrees with respect to the equatorial plane and 700 km of altitude. The spacecraft is to be launched by the Brazilian VLS rocket from the Brazilian equatorial launching facility Alcantara. Details on such a satellite program will be given in this presentation. The plans for the second satellite were incomplete by the time that this paper was written, thus it will not be focused upon here

   83:  Two rocket observations of the OI lambda 557.7 nm nightglow emissio in the lower thermosphere have been carried out from the equatorial region at Natal (5.8 degrees S, 35.2 degrees W), one on 9 December 1985 and the other on 31 October 1986. The volume emission rate obtained from these observations showed a maximum at a height of 97+-1 km with a half-width of 6 km for the first experiment and 98+-1 km with a half-width of 7 km for the second experiment. The observed emission profiles showed large variability, suggesting dynamical control of the atomic oxygen. The atomic oxygen density profiles deduced from the present data are compared with atmospheric models and currently available experimental data

   83:  The Equatorial Ionosphere-Thermosphere Coupling and Dynamics (EITCD) symposium organized with the 7th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (SAGA) held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 8 to 20 August 1993, served to bring together recent results on experimental, theoretical and modelling studies. It reflected the steady progress, over the last few years, in improved understanding of the complex problems of the equatorial region. During these years some internationally coordinated projects were initiated with the specific objective of focussing collaborative efforts on the outstanding problems in equatorial geomagnetism and aeronomy. The Equatorial Ionosphere-Thermosphere System (EITS) project within Working Group 3 of the Solar Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) of the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP), and the International Equatorial Electrojet Year (IEEY) project coordinated by SAGA through its Inter-Divisional Commission on Developing Countries (ICDC) are two of the most comprehensive of such projects. A few observational campaigns were coordinated (and a few more are planned) jointly by these two projects. The IAGA EITCD Symposium, cosponsored by SCOSTEP, served as a forum for presenting some first results from these campaigns. Of the 45 papers accepted for presentation at the Symposium, 25 covered the following seven topics: Equatorial electric fields and winds; Ionosphere-thermosphere coupling-observation and modelling of the equatorial anomalies in temperature, densities and wind; Tides, winds and longitudinal effects in the equatorial electrojet; Planetary wave effects in the EITS; Plasma instability processes in equatorial spread F and electrojet; Airglow; and Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at equatorial latitudes. Selected papers from those presented at the Symposium are published in this special issue of the Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics. As convenors of the Symposium we are grateful to Prof. M.J. Rycroft, the Editor-in-chief, for offering us the opportunity to publish these papers from the EITCD Symposium

   83:  Data sets collected during a few coordinated Equatorial Ionosphere-Thermosphere System (EITS) observational campaign periods, mainly from the Brazilian and Asian longitude sectors are analysed in this paper. Ionosonde magnetometer and Ionosphere Electron Content (IEC) data from the EITS-1 and -2 campaigns (during March and December 1991) are complemented by interplanetary magnetic field and some ground based data sets from other campaigns. The analysis focuses on the response of the equatorial ionospheric heights and ionizaton anomaly to disturbance electric fields, identified as a direct penetration electric field associated with IMF B, changes and development of the ring current (especially the asymmetric component), and that produced by a disturbance zonal neutral wind. New evidence on the local time and longitudinal dependences of these electric fields constitute the main results of this paper. Especially, a large eastward electric field (associated with the asymmetric ring current) in the dusk-dawn sector causes significant expansion of the EIA in this sector, and amplification of the evening preversal uplift of the F-layer over Brazil. Significant inhibition of the evening prereversal electric field enhancement seems to be produced by the disturbance zonal wind associated with the magnetic disturbances prevailing several hours earlier. Some tentative evidence on the Brazilian dusk sector disturbance field being larger than that of the Asian dusk sector support the existence of a longitude asymmetry in the intensity of the disturbance electric field

   83:  Although the existence of thin ionized layers at heights around 100km has been known for many years, it is only much more recently that thin neutral metal layers have been observed. Such layers, initially sodium and more recently calcium and iron, have been detected by lidar. The layers, with thicknesses between about 100 m and several kilometers, and concentrations between about 10 2 and  10 5 cm -3, occur most frequently between 90 and 100 km, and are normally superimposed on a background layer about 10 km thick. The occurrence of thin neutral layers appears to be latitude dependent, and is strongly linked to the appearance of Es on ionograms. Several causative mechanisms have been suggested, none of which appears to be capable of providing an altogether satisfactory explanation for the formation of the layers

   83:  Atmospheric gravity waves, detected over Kiruna (67.8 degrees N, 20.4 degrees E) during geomagnetic storms, are presented and analysed. The data include direct measurements of the OI 630.0 nm emission line intensity, the x-component of the local geomagnetic field and thermospheric (meridional and zonal) wind velocities derived from the OI 630.0 nm Doppler shift observed with an imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer (IFPI). A low pass band filter technique was used to determine short-period variations in the thermospheric meridional wind velocities observed during geomagnetic storms. These short-period variations in the meridional wind velocities, which are identified as due to gravity waves, are compared to the corresponding variations observed in the OI 630.0 nm emission line intensity, x-component of the local geomagnetic field and the location of the auroral electrojet. A cross-correlation analysis was used to calculate the propagation velocities of the observed gravity waves

   83:  It is well-known that, at equatorial and low-latitudes, the OI 557.7 nm emission emanates both from the mesosphere and F-region. Earlier investigations using, in general, ground-based simultaneous obeservations indicate that the contribution to the OI 557.7 nm emission from the F-region is about 20
   83:   of the F-region OI 630.0 nm emission. Both of these emissions are excited by the dissociative recombination  process (O+2+e-O*(1S, 1D)+O) in the F-region. The nocturnal intensity variations of these emissions sometimes show large short-lived depletions, associated with the passage of equatorial spread-F plasma bubbles through the field of view of a photometer. Regular observations of these emissions have been carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W), Brazil, since 1973. In this paper, we present and discuss simultaneous observations of these emissions, during periods of strong equatorial spread-F conditions, when both emissions show large intensity drop-outs. Twenty-five nights of measurements from Cachoeira Paulista have been analysed for this study, which indicate that the average ratio of the intensity depletions (Delta I557.7 nm/Delta I630 nm) is about 0.26+-0.07 for F-region altitudes, and this components has a dependence on the eight of the electron density profile

   83:  Simultaneous measurements of the OI 557.7 nm, O2 atmospheric (0,1) band, NaD and OH (9,4) band emissions obtained during the period October-November 1989 at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degrees S, 45 degrees W), Brazil, have been analysed to study gravity waves in the mesospheric region at a low-latitude station in the southern hemisphere. It was found that, when these emissions showed large temporal intensity variations, there were also short period quasi-coherent temporal variations superposed on them, suggesting a possible passage of internal gravity waves in the emission layers. Cross-correlation analysis indicates that the time lag between the different emissions is smaller for short period variations compared with the long period variations. The wave parameters, namely a vertical wavelength of 12 km, a horizontal derived wavelentgh of 200 km with a period of 80 min, estimated from one of the observed short-period coherent oscillations, are typical of the internal gravity waves at the airglow emission height

   83:  Ion drift meter observations from the Atmosphere Explorer E satellite during the period of January 1977 to December 1979 are used to study the dependence of equatorial (dip latitudes <- 7.5 degrees) F region vertical plasma drifts (east-west electric fields) on solar activity, season, and longitude. The satellite-observed ion drifts show large day-to-day and seasonal variations. Solar cycle effects are most pronounced near the dusk sector with a large increase of the prereversal velocity enhancement from solar minimum to maximum. The diurnal, seasonal, and solar cycle dependence of the longitudinally averaged drifts are consistent with results from the Jicamarca radar except near the June solstice when AE-E nighttime downward velocities are significantly smaller than those observed by the radar. Pronounced presunrise downward drift enhancements are often observed over a large longitudinal range but not in the Peruvian equatorial region. The satellite data indicate that longitudinal variations are largest near the June solstice, particularly near dawn and dusk but are virtually absent during equinox. The longitudinal dependence of the AE-E vertical drifts is consistent with results from ionosonde data. These measurements were also used to develop a description of equatorial F region vertical drifts in four longitudinal sectors

   83:  The upper mesospheric and lower thermosphere airglow emissions, OI 557.7 nm, NaD 589.3 nm and the OH (9,4) band and its rotational temperature have been measured using a ground-based multichannel airglow photometer located at Fortaleza (3.9 degrees S, 38.4 degrees W) since 1986. The observed emission intensities show predominantly semi-annual oscillations with maxima at the equinoxes and minima during the solstices. The amplitudes of the oscillations are larger than those observed from the low latitude station, Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W). The OH rotational temperature, which represents a gas kinetic atmospheric temperature at around 85-95 km, also shows a strong semi-annual oscillation, 18 K peak to peak, with an average value around 10 K higher than that observed from Cachoeira Paulista. These results do not agree with model atmospheres presently available. It is suggested that the differences result from the effects of seasonal variations in vertical eddy transport and/or meridional circulation

Relative atmospheric density and absolute temperature profiles between 35 and 70 km of height were determined. The performance of the lidar system was evaluated on the basis of the number of laser shots necessary to attain a certain accuracy. Measured temperature profiles show consistently colder stratosphere and a hotter mesosphere compared with available models

The ring core sensor and electronic circuits of the magnetometer are acommodated in a PVC tube with a diameter of 20 cm and height of 35 cm. The magnetometer has three analog outputs of +- 5 volt or +- 1000 nanoTesla corresponding to the H, D and Z components. It has a precision better than 1.0 nanoTesla.

   83:  O modelo termosferico global, tridimensional e dependente do tempo desenvolvido na University College London (UCL) foi usado para estudar o comportamento sazonal dos ventos neutros e temperaturas em funcao do ciclo solar, durante um periodo geomagneticamente calmo. Foi encontrada uma variacao sazonal significativa em ambos os ventos meridional e zonal. O padrao sazonal da temperatura termosferica e das velocidades dos ventos neutros nao apresentou mudancas em funcao do ciclo solar, embora a temperatura termosferica seja de 300 K a 400 K mais fria durante o periodo de atividade solar minima e a velocidade dos ventos tenha apresentado uma variacao diurna com uma amplitude maior durante o periodo de atividade solar maxima. Sao apresentadas e discutidas as comparacoes entre os resultados das simulacoes e as observacoes de ventos neutros realizadas em tres localidades de baixas latitudes: Cachoeira Paulista (23 graus S, 45 graus W, 15 graus S latitude magnetica), Arequipa (16,5 graus S, 71,5 graus W, 3,2 graus S latitude magnetica) e Arecibo (18,3 graus N, 66,8 graus W, 30 graus N latitude magnetica)

   83:  Simultaneous zenith measurements of the OI 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm nightglow emissions, using a multi-channel tilting filter type photometer and nighttime thermospheric neutral wind velocities from the Doppler shifts of the OI 630.0 nm emission line, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer, have been carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degrees S, 45 degrees W), Brazil, during 1988-1991. These measurements constitute a unique opportunity to study the relationship between the generation of F-region plasma bubbles (regions of depleted electron densities) and thermospheric dynamics. During the period of March 1988 to June 1991, we have 9 nights on which there were nearly full nights of simultaneous observations of thermospheric wind velocities (zonal and meridional) and the OI 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm emissions showing formation of plasma bubbles. On the night of March 18, 1991, the zonal wind was unusually strong in the beginning of the night (300 m/s) and this night shows very strong formation of plasma bubbles, indicating that a strong zonal wind in some way may be connected with plasma bubble formation through the electric field created by the interaction between the zonal wind and the Earth's magnetic field. However, both the zonal and meridional winds on several nights with, and without plasma bubbles, are comparable. This feature possibly indicates only a secondary role of thermospheric winds in the generation of the equatorial ionospheric plasma depletions. It should be pointed out that an analysis of the nocturnal intensity variations of simultaneous mesospheric (E-region) emissions (O1 557.7 nm, O-2 atm. 864.5 nm, NaD 589.0 nm and OH (9-4) 775.0 nm) on all the nine nights studied, shows the presence of gravity waves, indicating possible relation between wave processes in the mesosphere and F-region irregularities

   83:  Observations of nighttime thermospheric neutral wind velocities and temperatures from measurements of Doppler shifts and widths, respectively, of the OI 630.0 nm airglow emission line, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer, have been carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degrees S, 45 degrees W), Brazil, since 1988. In this paper we present observations of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures during the period July 6-10, 1991, which included the strong magnetic disturbance of July 8-9, 1991 when the Kp value reached 8. During this storm the meridional and zonal neutral wind velocity patterns were strongly modified. On July 9-10, the observed meridional wind during the storm shows a behaviour opposite to that observed during winter and the observed zonal wind at the beginning of the night shows a behaviour similar to its quiet time behaviour (to the east), but at 01:15 LT the zonal wind changes its direction rapidly to the west and at 03:45 LT it reverses to east again. Also, from the observed thermospheric temperatures, inferred from the thermal broadening of the 630.0 nm line emission, we find that during this event there is thermospheric cooling over Cachoeira Paulista. This result is surprising, because we would normally expect thermospheric heating during geomagnetic storms, since a large amount of energy is deposited in the thermosphere at high latitudes

   83:  Specifically for the total solar eclipse of Nov. 3, 1994 observations, a 30 Mhz riometer, with a Yagi-Uda antenna, was installed in the vicinities of Sao Bento Alto (28 degrees 42'34"S, 49 degrees 30'37"W), very near the center of the Moon shadow. At the same time two other riometer stations were in operation, one at a lower latitude (C.Paulista) and the other at a subauroral latitude (brazilian station) in Antarctica. In S.B. Alto, contrary to the expectations, a noticeable enhancement of ionospheric absorption started several minutes after the first contact, lasting for few hours. No such effect was noticed on the other riometer stations. However, peculiar periodic kinks have been recorded during and after the solar eclipse by the C. Paulista riometer. Based on these experimental results a preliminary interpretaton, based on energetic particle precipitation from the Van Allen radiation belts, into the atmosphere if the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, is offered

   83:  A time-dependent three-dimensional computer simulation of equatorial F region ionosphere has been carried out to understand the electron temperature structure observed by Hinotori satellite in the low and middle ionosphere. This model provides three-dimensional distributions of ion densities, electron temperature, and ion temperatures. The simulations showed the electron temperature enhancements around the equator in the morning, in the midlatitude in the afternoon, and around the equatorial anomaly region from afternoon to midnight. The enhancements in the morning are due to photoelectron heating. The afternoon enhancements in the midlatitude come from the balance of heating and cooling. When no meridional neutral wind is included in the simulation, the electron temperature did not show remarkable enhancements in the midlatitude in the afternoon because of strong cooling by the dense electron density. Around the equatorial anomaly region the electron temperature increased at high altitude in the evening because of the competing effects of plasma cooling and the plasma movements. Since the ionospheric plasma zonal E x B drift is eastward near the sunset (where E is ionospheric electric field and B is magnetic field) and the vertical drift is downward, the high-altitude dayside hot plasma can enter into the topside F region in the premidnight. The computer simulations were directly compared with the Hinotori satellite data. The simulation results were consistent with the equatorial electron density and temperature observed by the Hinotori satellite

Some 26 out of the 33 papers that constitute this book directly address the subject of low latitude ionospheric physics, while the remainder mainly concern midlatitude or other problems which are also of some relevance to the low latitude ionosphere. Our existing understanding of ionospheric currents, electric fields, small and large scale plasma structures, the equatorial anomaly, atmospheric gravity waves, TID's, field-aligned irregularities, etc. constitutes the key topics of the various articles presented here. About half of these are of review nature, and half focus on new results

   83:  On May 31, 1992, a rocket payload equipped with 10 airglow photometers was launched from the Alcantara Launch Center in northern Brazil. The payload measured sodium, hydroxyl, atomic, and molecular oxygen airglow emissions, and a sodium lidar, operating at the launch site, provided simultaneous vertical profiles of atmospheric sodium density. The airglow profiles, in conjunction with the sodium density distribution, are used to derive vertical profiles for atomic oxygen, ozone and hydrogen in the 80 to 100 km region. These profiles are then used as inputs to a photochemical model for the sodium layer. Good agreement is achieved between the modeled and experimental profiles of sodium and Na D line airglow, and the results indicate that the branching ratio for the production of Na (2P) in the reaction NaO+O Na(2P, 2S)+O2 must be between 0.05 and 0.20

This brief review, which is mainly concerned with work related to the chemistry and dynamics of the neutral mesosphere and lower thermosphere, describes INPE's facilities for research in these areas, and presents some recent results.

The data were registered during some periods from 1990 to 1993. The comparison is made for the F region paramets NmF2 and hmF2 and for true height profiles as well. The analysis, based on the quietest days during the data period, shows that while IRI provides realistic profiles during daytime hours of high solar activity periods, it seems to underestimate the bottomside electron density during the early morning and late afternoon hours. The F-layer peak density obtained using the CCIR-89 coefficients are understimated for most of the nightime hours during equinox and summer months of high solar activity periods, and overestimated for most of the time during low solar activity

   83:  Ionospheric Electron Content (IEC), measured at the Brazilian low latitude station of Cachoeira Paulista (22.5 degrees S, 45 degrees W, dip latitude 14 degrees S) was compared with IEC calculated using the IRI-90 and Sheffield University Plasmaphere-Ionosphere (SUPIM) models for a large range of solar fluxes at 10.7 cm (F10.7). The analysis of the 10.7 influence on IEC showed that, for Cachoeira Paulista (CP) at 05 LT (around the diurnal minimum) there is a good agreement between the IEC measurements and the models. At 16 LT (around the diurnal maximum), substantial discrepancies were observed in the IRI-90 results while SUPIM presents a good agreement up to F10.7 = 200. The measured IEC diurnal variation is better represented by SUPIM, mainly during higher F10.7. At low latitudes two critical parametric inputs for the SUPIM mathematical model are the equatorial ExB plasma drifts and thermospheric neutral winds. Therefore, updated values of these parameters should be introduced in the model calculations everytime they are available. At CP, a station located close to the southern Appleton anomaly peak due to the fountain effect, where large discrepancies between IRI-90 and observations were found with high F10.7, this model should include adequately this effect, which we believe is the main reason for the discrepancies

   83:  This paper presents an overview of the existing results of comparisons between the IRI-90 predictions and the observational data for the Brazilian longitude sector and attempts to place the major findings in a global perspective. The observational data subjected to comparison with the IRI model include NmF2/foF2 (the peak density/critical frequency of the F2-layer), hmF2/hpF2 (the height of NmF2/foF2), TEC (total ionospheric electron content) and the electron density-height profiles. The Brazilian stations for which results are presented are: Fortaleza near the magnetic equator and Cachoeira Paulista near the equatorial anomaly crest. The results are compared with those from Asia and Indian longitude sectors. An attempt is made to identify points of agreement/disagreement between the observational data and the IRI. Seasonal and solar activity dependent persistent trends of discrepancies have been found with respect the NmF2, hmF2 and TEC. We have tried to highlight the global nature of such discrepancies aiming at providing an eventual basis for incorporating needed modification for improving the predictive capability of the IRI for the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere

The comparison, carried out using the Sheffield University Plasmaphere-Ionosphere Model with the same perpendicular ExB drift velocity at all locations, is aimed to investigate the modulating effect of neutral wind. The neutral wind is found to produce north-south asymmetries in the plasma fountain and anomaly, with larger plasma flow and stronger anomaly crests occurring in opposite hemispheres at all locations. The north-south asymmetry in the plasma fountain is stronger at locations of larger displacement between the geomagnetic and geographic equators than at locations of larger magnetic declination angle. The vertical ExB drift velocities at the magnetic equators of Trivandrum and Fortaleza are also derived by matching the measured and model values of the peak height hmax. The derived velocities (which correspond to the ionospheric peak) are compared with that measured at Jicamarca using the incoherent scatter radar

   83:  The coded-aperture technique for reconstructing images for a position-sensitive detector looking through a stationary URA mask requires that the background illumination be distributed uniformly accross the surface of the detector. Non-uniformities in the background are typical of balloon and space-borne detectors, and introduce large artifacts into the reconstructed image, with a subsequent loss of signal-to-noise. Here we describe a technique, employed for the Energetic X-ray Imaging Telescope Experiment (EXITE) to remove the systematic effects of non-uniform background. We explore the time dependence of intensity and two-dimensional shape of the background detector image during the flight. We construct a "flat field" image from observations where x-rays sources were absent from the field of view. We demonstrate that this technique can successfully reduce RMS fluctuations to within a few percent of ideal Poisson statistics

   83:  A new imaging balloon-borne telescope for hard X-rays in the energy range from 30 to 100 keV is described. The imaging capability is provided by the use of an extended URA-based coded-mask. With only one motor and suitable stop pins we can rotate a carbon-fiber wheel with most of the mask elements attached to it by 180 degrees, and a bar, which is also part of the mask pattern and is allowed to rotate freely over the wheel, by 90 degrees; this combined rotation creates an antimask of the original mask, except for the central element. This is a novel and elegant manner of providing an antimask without additional weight and complex mechanical manipulations. We show that the use of antimasks is a very effective method of eliminating systematic variations in the background map over the position-sensitive detector area. The expected sensivity of the instrument for the 30-100 keV range is of the order of 7 x 10-5 photons cm-2 s-1 keV-1, for an integration time of 10 4 seconds at a residual atmosphere of 3.5 g cm-2. This telescope will provide imaging observations of bright galactic hard X-ray sources with an angular resolution of 2 degrees in a 10 degrees by 10 degrees FOV, which is defined by a collimator placed in front of the detector system. We are particularly interested in the galactic center region, where recent imaging results in X-rays have shown the presence of an interesting source field. Results of computer simulations of the imaging system are reported

   83:  We designed, constructed and tested at 4.2 K (using two different low phase noise electrical pump generators) a cryogenic double-resonant parabridge motion transducer made out of niobium, whose electrical output was amplified by a two-stage metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor cryogenic amplifier. Most of the experimental results agreed well with the theoretical models. We were able to adjust the two electrical bridge resonant frequencies at the pump frequency, allowing us to obtain an electromechanical coupling as high as 0.054, and we successfully measured the mechanical Brownian motion of this transducer. In one case, we observed a dip in the electrical noise spectrum near the mechanical resonant frequency due to destructive interference between this noise and its "reflection" from the mechanical resonator. At the bottom of this dip, in a bandwidth of 0.7 Hz, we measured an equivalent displacement noise of 4 x 10-16 m/ Hz with a systematic error of less than 10

   83:  We have developed a program to map the accretion disk brightness distribution in cataclysmic variables from their eclipse light curves. This program is an alternative implementation of the Eclipse Mapping Method (Horne, 1985), employing penalty function optimization techniques with a conjugate-gradient algorithm. To improve the method's performance when faced with relatively low signal-to-noise (S/N) input data we used the combination of qui2  and another statistic (T'), which measures the correlation between the residuals and the inverse of the measured fluxes, as the statistical consistency check. This avoids the occurrence of the biased residuals in the light curve, present when the qui2 statistic alone is used. We applied this method to map the accretion disk brightness in V4140 Sgr (NSV 12615). The analysis of the reconstructed images suggests the existence of an optically thick disk, which presents a temperature distribution with radial dependency very close to the one expected from the standard accretion disk model (T  R-3/4). The results are compatible with the scenario proposed for V4140 Sgr by Baptista, Jablonski  Steiner (1989), emphasizing the differences between this system and the ultrashort period eclipsing dwarf novae

   83:  A sample of high-resolution AGN narrow spectral line profiles is statistically analysed. Lines included are narrow H alfa and H beta, [N ii] gamma6583, [S ii] gamma gamma6717, 6731, [O iii] gamma5007 and [Oi] gamma6300. Although not very large, differences in width and shape between these lines, seen in the same object, are found to be significant. The range spanned by these differences is the same object, are found to be significant. The range spanned by these differences is the same in Seyfert 1 (Sy 1), Seyfert 2 (Sy 2) and LINER objects. Width and shape profile parameters show systematic dependences with ionization potential and critical density of each forbidden emission line. These dependences are significantly different in nature between Sy 1 and 2 classes. In Sy 1, there is clear evidence that regions with larger internal velocities emit preferentially lines of higher ionization conditions. There is also evidence that regions of higher electron density are associated with larger internal velocities. There is marginal evidence that the linewidths of forbidden lines in Sy 1 objects correlate better with critical density than with ionization potential. Sy 2 objects, on the contrary, do not show the same correlations of linewidths and shape with ionization conditions. In a particular object, forbidden lines of higher ionization can be wider or narrower than lines of low ionization. The results indicate that in Sy 1 objects the central ionization source plays a fundamental role in shaping the narrow-line region structure. The same is not necessarily true in Sy 2 galaxies, in which the narrow-line region line profiles seem to depend on other factors besides the central location of the ionization source

We present UBVRI photometric measurements that cover both bright and faint states of the variable, together with simultaneous spectroscopic coverage of an outburst from minimum to maximum along three nights. The low semi-amplitude of the H  radial velocity curve (K40 km s-1), together with other spectroscopic constraints, indicates a low inclination (i40 degrees) for the system, and a probable mass of 0.8 M  for the white dwarf

   83:  We studied the gamma-ray flux from SN 1987A with a balloon-borne detector in Brazil on 1990 November 29. By comparing on- and off-source data, we obtained limits to the total gamma-ray flux due to 57Co decays and presumed pulsar activity. If the pulsar contribution is neglected, an upper limit (90
   83:   confidence limit) is set to the total 57Co contribution above 60 keV at 2.7 x 10-4 cm-2 s-1 where the 122 keV line contribution is 1.10 x 10-4 cm-2 s-1. The corresponding limit on the abundance ratio of 57Co and 56Co is 3.4 times that of the Sun. The present upper limit implies that the reported leveling off in the light curve of SN 1987A is primarily due to the pulsar activity. If the pulsar is Crab-like (photon index -2.2), the light curve requires an energy outflow greater than 0.95 x 10 37 ergs s-1 (above 1 keV) now being supplied to SN 1987A by its presumed pulsar

Nine of the bursts were observed simultaneously with the Hard X-ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS)  on the Solar Maximimum Mission (SMM). The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) observed five of these events from 1 to 18 GHz. To date, we have analyzed six of these events and the preliminary results are: (i) The turnover frequency of all of these bursts were in the frequency range of 7 - 11 GHz and the radio spectral index ranged from -0.3 to -5.3; (ii) In three bursts, dominant features of high energy (>-200 keV) X-rays coincided in time with mm-wavelenght peaks, suggesting that the high energy electrons are responsible for the mm-wavelenght emission

   83:  Decimetric Solar Radio Spetroscope has been put into operation since March 1991 at Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil. Presently, it is operating over frequency range of (1.6+-0.1) GHz, with time resolution of 100 ms and frequency resolution of (0.3-3) MHz, in conjunction with a 9 m diameter polar mounted antenna. The dynamic spectra are recorded on 35 mm film, while 20 frequencies each separated by 10 MHz are digitized with time resolution of 100 ms. So far, various types of bursts have been observed by this system. Morphological studies of these bursts are presented. Particularly interesting are reverse slope (RS) type III bursts. Soon this system will start operating over a frequency range of (0.2-2.5) GHz, simultaneously in two circular polarizations. Flexibility of this system permits to select desired frequency range with resolution in time of (1-250) ms and in frequency of (0.1-3)MHz

   83:  We have developed and flown a 1 meter diameter Gregorian telescope system for measurements of anisotropy in the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR). The telescope in incorporated in a balloon-borne stabilized platform with arcminute stabilization capability. To date the system has flown 4 times and observed from the ground at the South Pole twice. The telescope has used both coherent and incoherent detectors. We describe the development of the telescope, pointing platform, and one of the receivers employed in making measurements of the CBR. Performance of the system during the first flight and operation on the ground at the South Pole are described, and the quality of the South Pole as a milimeter wave observing site is discussed

   83:  We have discovered a coherent photometric modulation in Nova Oph 1988 with period 0.117515+-0.000002 d (2.82 hr) which we associate to the orbital period of the underlying binary. This places the system at the upper side of the gap of the cataclysmic variables'(CVs) period distribution. The striking similarity of the orbital light curve with that of AM Her and the presence of prominent He ii lines in the optical spectrum-similar to the magnetic nova candidates V1500 Cyg, GQ Mus, and CP Pup-strongly suggest that this is also a magnetic nova. Inclusion of this object in the statistics of novae raises an interesting scenario. There are presently four novae with known orbital period Porb<3 hr, half of which lie in the period gap. All these systems are suspected to harbor magnetic white dwarfs. This evidence suggests (1) that there is no period gap for novae, and (2) that magnetic CVs are strongly favored among novae for Porb<3.3 hr. Implications and support for these conclusions are discussed in the light of thermonuclear runaway models and the hibernation model of classical novae, and of current models to explain the period gap

   83:  We report further results from the University of California at Santa Barbara program to measure anisotropy in the cosmic background radiation to angular scales near 1 degree, an angular range corresponding to the largest scales where structure is observed. A 30 GHz high electron mobility transistor amplifier based detector was coupled to the Advanced Cosmic Microwave Explorer, a 1 m off axis Gregorian telescope. We present data that represent 64 of the total of 500 hr acquired with this system during the 1990-1991 season. The data have a statistical error of 13.5  miK pixel -1. These are the smallest error bars of any data set of this type published to date. The data contain a significant signal with a maximum likelihood   deltaT/T 1 x 10-5, under the assumption of a Gaussian sky autocorrelation function at a coherence angle of 1.5 degree. The spectrum of the signal seen in slightly less than 2 sigma away from the thermal spectrum expected of primordial fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation. If the source of the fluctuations is primordial, then the data are consistent with cold dark matter scenarios when normalized to the large-scale anisotropy observed by COBE, while if the origin of the signal is foreground emission or another form of contaminant then the data are marginally inconsistent with standard cold dark matter models. In either case, the data are sufficiently sensitive to provide a crucial test of many models

   83:  We present some results of the analytical integration of the energy rate balance equation, assuming that the input energy rate is proportional to the azimuthal interplanetary electric field, Ey, and can be described by simple rectangular or triangular functions, as approximations to the frequently observed shapes of E, especially during the passage of magnetic clouds. The input function is also parametrized by a reconnection-transfer efficiency factor   (which is assumed to vary between 0. 1 and 1). Our aim is to solve the balance equation and derive values for the decay parameter 'c compatible with the observed Dst peak values. To facilitate the analytical integration we assume a constant value for T through the main phase of the storm. The model is tested for two isolated and well-monitored intense storms. For these storms the analytical results are compared to those obtained by the numerical integration of the balance equation, based on the interplanetary data collected by the ISEE-3 satellite, ,with the T values parametrized close to those obtained by the analytical study. From the best fit between this numerical integration and the observed Dst the most appropriate values of r are then determined. Although we specifically focus on the main phase of the storms, this numerical integration has been also extended to the recovery phase by an independent adjust. The results of the best fit for the recovery phase show that the values of r may differ drastically from those corresponding to the main phase. The values of the decay parameter for the main phase of each event, c, are found to be very sensitive to the adopted efficiency factor,   , decreasing as this factor increases. For the recovery phase, which is characterized by very low values of the power input, the response function becomes almost independent of the value of    and the resulting values for the decay time parameter, Tr do not vary greatly as   varies. As a consequence, the relative values of T between the main and the recovery phase , Tm/Tr, can be greater or smaller than one as   varies from 0.1 to

Photoelectric U BV RI and short CCD time series photometry were also obtained for most of these objects. RT Cru presented brightness variations with time scales of 10-30 minutes and amplitude 0.03-0.05 mag in the V band and up to 0.09 mag in the B band; the other stars have not shown short time variations. RT Cru, HI-25, NSV 10435 and NSV 11776 are classified among the symbiotic stars

   83:  We present results from a four-frequency observation of a 6 degrees x 0.6 degree strip of the sky centered near the star Gamma Ursae Minoris (GUM) during the fourth flight of the Millimeter-wave Anisotropy eXperiment (MAX). The observation was made with a 1.4 degree peak-to-peak sinusoidal chop in all bands. The FWHM beam sizes were 0.55 degree +- 0.05 degree at 3.5 cm-1 and 0.75 degree +- 0.05 degree at 6, 9 and 14 cm-1.During this observation significant correlated structure was observed at 3.5, 6 and 9 cm-1 with amplitudes similar to those observed in the GUM region during the second and third flights of MAX. The frequency spectrum is consistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and inconsistent with thermal emission from interstellar dust. The extrapoled amplitudes of synchrotron and free-free emission are too small to account for the amplitude of the observed structure. If all of the structure is attributed to CMB anisotropy with a Gaussian autocorrelation function and a coherence angle of 25', then the most probable values of delta T/T cmb in the 3.5, 6, and 9 cm-1 bands are 4.3+2.7-1.6 x 10-5, 2.8+4.3-1.1 x 10-5, and 3.5+3.0-1.6 x 10-5 (95

   83:  A study of the eclipses in UU Aqr from multicolor high-speed photometry is presented. A revised ephemeris for the times of minimum and an upper limit for orbital period variations are obtained. We use measurements of contact phases in the eclipse light curve to derive the binary geometry and to estimate masses and relevant dimensions. We find a mass ratio of q=0.30+-0.07 and an inclination of i=78 degrees +- 2 degrees. The masses of the component stars are M1=0.67+-0.14 M  and M2=0.20+-0.07 M . Our photometric model predicts K1=84+-26 km s-1, which is 30
   83:   smaller than the velocity amplitude obtained from the emission lines. From the white dwarf fluxes we estimate Twd-34.000 K and a distance of d=270+-50 pc if the inner disk is opaque. UU Aqr has long-term brightness variations of 0m.3 on timescales of 4 yr. The system was in a "high" state in 1989 and 1990 and in a "low" state in 1988 and 1992. The high state results from an increase in the brightness of the outer and cooler parts of the disk, mainly due to the appearance of a bright spot at disk rim. Based on the smooth and gradual eclipse shape and on the absence of a prominent hump in the light curve we suggest that UU Aqr is a high mass-transfer nova-like system with a relatively bright and optically thick accretion disk. We find no perceptible eclipse in the Halfa emission line. The fluxes at mid-eclipse can be fitted by a composition of a late-type spectrum plus an optically thin hydrogen emission-line spectrum. These evidences suggest that the emission lines are formed in an extended region only partially occulted during eclipse

The permitted and forbidden line-widths are typical of Seyfert 2 galaxies. The absolute magnitude is Mv=-23.6 and the reddening is Av-1.1. The unreddened absolute magnitude (Mv)0- -24.7 makes this the most luminous known narrow-line (type 2) quasar. Similarities with X-ray-detected Seyfert 2 and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, as well as implications for the unified model for active galactic nuclei (AGN), are discussed

   83:  A decimetric (1600 +- 100 MHz), high-sensivity digital spectroscope has been put into regular operation at Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, since 1991 March. The dynamic spectra are recorded on 35 mm film while 20 frequencies each separated by 10 MHz are digitized with time resolution of 100 ms. So far, about 350 groups of solar bursts have been observed by this system. These have been classified as microwave type and decimetric reverse slope (RS) type III bursts. Here, we report statistical investigations of the properties of the 44 moderately strong groups of decimetric type III-RS bursts. The average total duration of these bursts is ~0.7 s, the drift rate varied between ~400 and 3000 MHz s-1, and average decay time is ~120 ms. These observed drifts and timescales suggest that the decimetric type III-RS bursts are generated by beam plasma interaction at second harmonic in the inhomogeneous chromosphere, and that the acceleration region is located at a density level of <- 10 9 cm-3

   83:  A milimeter-wavelength (23-18 GHz) variable frequency radiometer with frequency resolution of 1 GHz and time resolution of 0.1-16 s has been developed in conjunction with a 13.7 m-diameter antenna. In this paper we describe briefly this new instrument, and its use to observe active regions. Spectra of four active regions show that: (i) spectra of the quiet-Sun region and those of the active region were of the same nature and the spectral index of both varied between -0.4 and +0.3; (ii) for two cases the spectra of the active region remained almost flat during the observing period of about one hour; (iii) spectra of the two other active regions exhibited frequency fine structures similar to the trough and crest type with a width of the order of 2 GHz in frequency and lasting about 40 to 90 min. The spectra of the quiet-Sun region and those of the active regions are attributed to bremsstrahlung emission. Fine structures in frequency type crest and trough are attributed to the radio signatures of the temperature plateau in the chromosphere

   83:  High-sensivity, high-spectral-resolution solar observations in the millimeter wavelength are scanty. A sensitive radiometer with 1 GHz resolution, operating between 18 and 23 GHz in conjunction with a 13.7 m diameter antenna has been in regular operation since the end of 1987. At present, each frequency is sampled for 100 ms, soon to be improved to 50 ms. Details of this instrumentation, including the processes of calibration, data acquisition, and reduction are described here. Also, preliminary observations of an active region and of the burst components are briefly described

   83:  We present matching-beam 6 and 2 cm radio continuum observations made with the Very Large Array, and ammonia and water maser observations made at the Haystack Observatory of 12 IRAS point sources selected from the survey of Scalise, Rodriguez  Mendoza-Torres (1989) of bright, unassociated IRAS point sources. These sources have 60 or 100  m flux densities in excess of 10 3 Jy and have no previous reference in any of the 37 catalogs considered for associaton of IRAS sources with known sources. Six of the 12 sources have associated radio continuum, ammonia, and water maser emission, and all of them show at least one of these three emissions. In all sources detected, the ammonia is warm (T  20 K) and suggests the association of dense molecular gas with embedded heating sources. It is argued that all sources in the sample could be associated with time-variable H2O maser emission. The radio and far-infrared data appear to indicate that these sources are star-forming regions, powered by a late O or early B-type star. Several of the sources of lower luminosity (5 x 10 3 L  )appear to have ionizing photon fluxes in excess of those expected for a zero-age main-sequence star. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed

   83:  We describe an imaging telescope for observations of celestial sources in the energy range between 30 keV and 1.8 MeV onboard stratospheric balloons. The detector is a 41 cm diameter, 5 cm thick NaI(TI) crystal coupled to 19 photomultipliers in an Anger camera configuration. It is surrounded  by a plastic scintillator 15 cm thick on the sides, 0.2 cm thick at the top and 20 cm thick at the bottom. The imaging device is based upon a 19 x 19 element square MURA (Modified Uniformly Redundant Array) coded mask mounted in an one-piece mask-antimask configuration. The detector's spatial resolution is about 10 mm at 100 keV. This is the first experiment to use such a mask pattern and configuration for astrophysical purposes. The expected 3sigma  sensivity for an on-axis source observed for 10 4 s at a residual atmosphere of 3.5 g cm-2 is 1.44 x 10 -5 photons cm-2 s-1 keV-1 at 1 MeV. The angular resolution is approximately 14 arcminutes over a 13 degrees field of view. The instrument is mounted in an automatic platform with a capability for pointing and stabilization in both azimuth and elevation axis with 2 arcmin accuracy

   83:  Seven different samples obtained from the Petrobras Oil Well 1-ICA-1BA from depths down to 1872 m have been studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron activation analysis. The X-ray diffraction showed the presence of clay minerals, feldspar, calcite, pyrite, quartz, dolomite, andrite and others. The neutron activation analysis has been used to obtain the iron concentration in the samples. The Mossbauer spectra were obtained both at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. Spectra are complex in nature indicating multiple sites or mixture of iron containing minerals. The spectra at 85 K could be least squares fitted are resolved up to four doublets with typical values of IS(Fe)=1.4, 1.21, 1.16, 0.40 and QS=3.62, 2.82, 2.37, 0.61 mm/s respectively. They have slightly large line widths except for the first doublet. Two samples also showed the presence of hematite

   83:  RE 0751 + 14 shows an 833-s spin pulsation which is quasi-sinusoidal in the blue, but double-peaked in the red. We present the first ephemeris for this pulsation. A weaker 872-s pulsation is also double-peaked, and is probably caused by reprocessing of the double-peaked X-ray pulse. The optical modulation at the implied orbital period is weaker than in any other intermediate polar, which suggests that RE 0751 + 14 is at low inclination

   83:  We observed a young rotation-powered pulsar, PSR 1509-58, in the hard X-ray/gamma-ray or the soft gamma-ray band with a balloon-borne detector in Brazil on 1991 November 19 (UT). With a timing analysis we detected pulsations in the energy band 94-240 keV at the 150.687 ms period determined from radio observations. The pulsating flux is (7.1 +- 1.7) x 10 -4 cm -2 s -1 in this band, and the energy spectrum follows a power law with photon index alfa=1.64 +- 0.4. The averaged pulse profile shows a broad single peak with  a sharp rise and has a duty cycle around 50
   83:   or higher: these features are similar to what have been observed in the X-ray band by the Ginga satellite. Based on the data available now, the fraction of energy transformed from rotational energy loss to pulsed/nonpulsed soft gamma-ray radiation is estimated. If the solid angle swept by the pulsed beam is about the same as for the Crab pulsar (PSR 0531 + 21) and the Vela pulsar (PSR 0833-45), PSR 1509-58 turn out to be an extremely efficient pulsar, converting a large fraction of its rotational energy loss to radiation, as the outer gap model predicts. The observed pulsed spectrum, however, is strong in the soft gamma-ray band, in a sharp contrast to what has been observed in the Vela pulsar, a pulsar expected to be similar PSR 1509-58 in the outer gap model. The fact that the pulse profile remains broad and single-peaked in the soft gamma-ray band is also new for Crab-like pulsars. In these regards, PSR 1509-58 may require some alteration to the standard outer gap model or even a new model for gamma-ray emission in pulsars

The experiment incorporates a one-piece mask-antimask system based on a 7x5 uniformly redundant array (URA) pattern, which has been shown to be very effective in reducing systematic variations of the background in the detector plane . The mask is placed at a distance of 1.5 m from the detector plane, which consists of 35 NaI(TI) scintillators (31.8 mm-diameter, 2 mm-thick), with a total area of 400 cm2. The detectors operate in the 30-100 keV energy range, divided in 32 energy channels. TIMAX is a prototype of a much larger experiment currently under development in laboratory

   83:  We present results from two observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) performed from the South Pole during the 1993-1994 austral summer. Each observation employed a 3 degree peak-to-peak sinusoidal, single-difference chop and consisted of a 20 degrees x 1 degree strip on the sky. The first observation used a receiver which operates in three channels between 38 and 45 GHz (Q-band) with a FWHM  beam which varies from 1 degree to 1.15 degree. The second observation overlapped the first observation and used a receiver which operates in four channels between 26 and 36 GHz (Ka-band) with a FWHM beam which varies from 1.5 degree to 1.7 degree. Significant correlated structure is observed in all channels for each observation. The spectrum of the structure is consistent with a CMB spectrum and is formally inconsistent with diffuse synchrotron and free-free emission at the  5 sigma level. The amplitude of the structure is inconsistent with 20 K interstellar dust; however, the data do not discriminate against flat or inverted spectrum point sources. The root mean square amplitude (+-1sigma) of the combined (Ka + Q) data is delta Trms=41.2+15.5-6.7 miK for an average window function which has a peak value of 0.97 at  =68 and drops to e-0.5 of the peak value at  =36 and  =106. A band power estimate of the CMB power spectrum C , gives <C  ( +1)/(2pi)>  =1.77+1.58-0.54 x 10 -10

   83:  In this work we analyze the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation observed by COBE and show that the distribution can be fitted by a fractal distribution with a fractal dimension D=1.43+-0.07. This value is in close agreement with the fractal dimension obtained by Coleman  Pietronero and Luo  Schramm from galaxy-galaxy and cluster-cluster correlations up to 100 h-1 Mpc. The fact that the observed temperature fluctuations correspond to scales much larger than 100 h-1 Mpc and are signatures of the primordial density fluctuations at the recombination layer suggests that the structure of the matter at the early universe was already fractal and nonhomogeneous on those scales. This result may have important consequences for the theoretical framework that describes the universe

   83:  The solar cycle distribution of intense geomagnetic storms has been studied for cycles 20 and 21 (1965-1985), using values of the Dst index <-100 nT, and for cycles 12-19 (1879-1964), using values of aa index >100 nT. It is claimed that a dominant dual-peak (DP) distribution exists in the solar cycle variability of these storms, with one peak occurring at the late ascending phase of the cycle or at solar maximum and another at the early descending phase of the cycle. From the 10 cycles studied, the average separation of the peaks from solar maximum is about 8 months ahead for the first peak and about 25 months after for the second one. For the cycles studied, the ratio of the average numbers of storms occurring at the peaks as compared with that occurring at the valley  of the DP distribution was found to be statistically significant to better than a 95  confidence level. Although the present study is restricted to intense storms, their distribution including moderate events for the interval 1965-1985, in terms of Dst values <-50 nT, also shows evidence of a dual-peak distribution. Thus, in contrast with previous work on the solar cycle distribution of geomagnetic storms, which have emphasized the idea that they tend to peak at the descending phase of the cycle, the present work provides evidence for another important enhancement of this distribution at the late ascending phase of the cycle, extending sometimes to solar maximum. The origin of the dual-peak distribution of intense storms is associated to a similar dual-peak distribution obtained for large-amplitude (<-10 nT) and long duration (>3 h) values of the negative Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), computed for the interval 1970-1981. This class of Bz fields was shown to be cause of all intense storms studied for the interval August 1978-December 1979 (Gonzalez and Tsurutani, 1987, Planet. Space. Sci. 35, 1101)

   83:  Nonthermal radio emissions near the local electron plasma frequency have been detected in various regions of interplanetary plasmas: solar wind, upstream of planetary bow shock, and heliopause. Energetic electron beams accelerated by solar flares, planetary bow shocks, and the terminal shock of heliosphere provide the energy source for these radio emissions. Thus, it is expected that similar nonthermal radiation processes may be responsible for the generation of these radio emissions. As energetic electron beams interact with interplanetary plasmas, intense Langmuir waves are excited due to a beam-plasma instability. The Langmuir waves then interact with low-frequency density fluctuations to produce radiations near the local electron plasma frequency. If Langmuir waves are of sufficiently large amplitude to exceed the threshold conditions, nonlinear mode conversion into electromagnetic waves can be effected through parametric instabilities. A number of electromagnetic parametric instabilities driven by intense Langmuir waves can be excited in a plasma: (1) electromagnetic decay/fusion instabilities driven by a traveling Langmuir pump; (2) double electromagnetic decay/fusion instabilities driven by two oppositely directed Langmuir pumps; and (3) electromagnetic oscillating two-stream instabilities driven by two counterstreaming Langmuir pumps. It is concluded that the electromagnetic parametric instabilities induced by Langmuir waves are likely sources of nonthermal radiations in interplanetary plasmas

   83:  It is shown that all widely used coupling functions about the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction can be derived as particular cases of general expressions for the electric  field and the energy transfer at the magnetopause due to large scale reconnection. Although the solar wind electric field gets transmitted along the reconnection line (e.g. Gonzalez and Mozer, 1974, J. Geophys. Res., 79, 4186), it is also shown that the net effect of this transmission in the magnetosphere seems to be associated only to the transverse component (dawn to dusk directon) of this field with respect to the geomagnetic field at the magnetopause. Furthermore, the most general expression for power transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere via a MHD process is shown to lead to similar limits for the coupling function as those obtained from the general expression for the reconnection power when the particular values for the power law index introduced by Vasyliunas et al. (1982, Planet. Space. Sci., 30, 359), about the dependence of the power transfer on the interplanetary Alfven Mach number, are used

   83:  For the intense magnetic storm of 28 August 1978 it is shown that the power transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere is well represented by the expression obtained by Vasyliunas et al. (1982, Planet. Space Sci. 30, 359) from dimensional analysis, but this representation becomes improved when such an expression is modified by a factor due to an influence of the lifetime of ring current particles as suggested by Lee and Akasofu (1984, Planet. Space Sci. 32, 1423). During a steady state regime of the ring current evolution of this storm, our study suggests that the power transfer depends on the solar wind density, the transverse component of the IMF (with respect to the Sun-Earth line) and also, explicitly, on the time constant for ring current energy decay, but not on the solar wind speed

   83:  Almost 1 year of IMP 8 interplanetary magnetic field and plasma data (days 1-312, 1979) have been examined to determine the interplanetary causes of geomagnetic AE activity. The nature of the interplanetary medium (Alfvenic or non-Alfvenic) and the Bs correlation with AE were examined over 12-hour increments throughout the study. It is found that Alfvenic wave intervals (defined as Vx-Bx cross-correlation coefficients of >0.6) are present over 60  of the time and the southward component of the Alfven waves is well correlated with AE (average peak correlation coefficient 0.62), with a median lag of 43 min. The most probable delay of AE from Bs is considerably shorter, about 20-25 min. Southward magnetic fields during non-Alfvenic intervals (Vx-Bx cross-correlation coefficient of <0.4) are equally effective in producing geomagnetic activity. Peak correlation coefficients and lags are similar of those Alfvenic intervals. From this statistical study, no major differences in the magnetospheric response to Alfvenic and non-Alfvenic intervals were obvious. The high-intensity long-duration continuous AE activity (HILDCAA) events discussed previously by Tsurutani and Gonzalez (1987) are demonstrated to be caused by the southward components of the Alfven waves, presumably through the process of magnetic reconnection. The lag times of AE from Bs were variable from event to event (and at different times within the Alfven wave train), ranging from 45 min. to as little as 0 min. The cause of this variable delay is somewhat surprising and not presently well understood

   83:  In a series of three interrelated articles, we have studied the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling process for 10 major (Dst <-100 nT) magnetic storms [Gonzalez et al., 1989], the interplanetary features that are responsible for the southward Bz causing the storms [Tsurutani et al., 1988], and the solar sources of the high-speed solar wind streams which contain the interplanetary magnetic field events [Tang et al., 1989]. Nine out of the 10 high-speed stream events were led by an interplanetary shock at 1 AU ( the tenth was associated with a noncompressional density enhancement or NCDE, [Gosling et al., 1977]. The 10 magnetic storms occurred during 1978-1979 [Gonzalez and Tsurutani, 1987], an interval near solar maximum (1979-1981)

   83:  We demonstrate the existence of a sharp break in the power spectrum of AE at 5 hours. At frequencies below the break, AE has a f-1.0 dependence, and at higher frequencies it has a f-2.2 to f-2.4 dependence. The power spectrum of the IMF Bs for the same time interval has a f1.4 dependence with no spectral breaks or peaks. Thus, at frequencies above the break, the power in AE varies as f-0.5 to f-0.8 times the power in Bs and at low frequencies it ranges from being f0 (frequency independent) to f+0.4 times the power in Bs. Several possible explanations of the nonlinear response of AE to the IMF Bs driver are briefly discussed, including: 1) variable ionospheric conductivity (increasing with Bs) for the high frequency regime, and 2) several AE saturation mechanisms for the low frequency regime

   83:  We present a review of recent work done on the topic of interplanetary and solar causes of geomagnetic activity. During solar maximum (1978-1979), 90 of the major magnetic storms (Dst <- 100 nT) are caused by large southward Bz events associated with interplanetary shocks. Of these, roughly half of the Bz events are located in the sheath and half associated with the driver gas. These two sources of southward IMFs often give magnetic storms a two-step profile. The sheath field events are generated in the interplanetary medium between the outer corona and the Earth from the "shocking" of the slow solar wind upstream of the high speed stream. In constrast, the driver gas events are fields which come from the solar source region. A correlation between the field orientation at the solar source and that at 1 a.u. was sought, but none was found. Thus, quantitative predictions of storm intensities from solar observations appear to be very difficult. Prominence eruptions are shown to be an important cause of the high speed solar wind streams that lead to magnetic storms. The other 10 of the major magnetic storms (Dst <- 100 nT) are caused by large southward Bz events associated with interplanetary shocks. Of these, roughly half of the Bz events are located in the sheath and half associated with the driver gas. These two sources of southward IMFs often give magnetic storms a two-step profile. The sheath field events are generated in the interplanetary medium between the outer corona and the Earth from the "shocking" of the slow solar wind upstream of the high speed stream. In constrast, the driver gas events are fields which come from the solar source region. A correlation between the field orientation at the solar source and that at 1 a.u. was sought, but none was found. Thus, quantitative predictions of storm intensities from solar observations appear to be very difficult. Prominence eruptions are shown to be an important cause of the high speed solar wind streams that lead to magnetic storms. The other 10 of the magnetic storms are not related to interplanetary shocks or high speed streams, but to high density "non-compressional density enhancements". Following magnetic storms are "high density long duration AE activity events"(HILDCAAs) that are series of continuous auroral substorms that last from days to weeks during of after the storm's recovery phase HILDCAAs can also occur independently of magnetic storms. This continuous auroral activity is caused by the southward component of the magnetic field of interplanetary Alfven waves, presumably through the process of magnetic reconnection with the Earth's field. These Alfven wave trains are often observed in the trailing portions of high speed streams. From an analysis of a year's data during solar maximum, it is found that the interplanetary medium is "Alfvenic" approx. 60  of the time. There appear to be no substantial differences in magnetopheric response to Alfvenic or non-Alfvenic interplanetary intervals. The magnetopause boundary layer is shown to contain broad-band ELF/VLF plasma waves at least 85  of the time at all dayside local times. These waves have sufficient amplitude to cause cross-field diffusion of magnetosheath plasma to form the low latitude boundary layer. Pitch angle scattering of the low latitude boundary layer particles is adequate to account for the dayside aurora. The only interplanetary/magnetosheath parameter that appears to affect the wave intensities is the IMF Bz. Although the waves are present at almost all times, they are intensified during southward IMF Bz intervals

(1987; Report, Space Research Institute of the U.S.S.R.) in the vicinity of a satellite when high-power radio waves were transmitted for topside sounding of the ionosphere. It is shown that, in the presence of supersonic Langmuir turbulence, electromagnetic radiation  near the local electron plasma frequency can be emitted through the electromagnetic parametric instabilities driven by intense Langmuir waves. The growth rates of these electromagnetic parametric instabilities are shown to be identical to the corresponding growth rates of the electrostatic Langmuir parametric instabilities. It is suggested that the stimulated electromagnetic emission can become a useful diagnostic technique for active experiments in space

   83:  Magnetotelluric, gravity and geothermal flux data are analysed to constrain the tectonic evolution of the Taubate Basin, a SW-NE 20 km wide and 170 km long rift-like Tertiary basin in southeastern Brazil. The basin is characterized by half-grabens and contains up to 1000 m of sediments cut by normal faults. The magnetotelluric measurements show the presence of two layers: an upper highly conductive one (less than 10 omega m from 1-D inversions), associated with Tertiary sediments, and an extremely resistive (more than 10 000 omega m) lower layer, related to the crystalline basement. Gravity anomalies in the region are ascribed to both near-surface sources, sediments and granites, and a deep-seated source associated with crustal thinning towards the continental margin. Available geothermal flux values within the basin are anomalously high; however, they have probably been affected by convective transport because  they were determined in water boreholes. These results suggest a stable thermal regime at present and, viewed together with the absence of magmatism and thermal subsidence, indicate that the mechanism related to the basin formation did not originate a deep-seated thermal anomaly in the region. The event can be seen as a shallow one, involving a small area in the upper part of the crust. The region can be characterized typically as a strike-slip mobile zone, with horizontal displacements between juxtaposed blocks. A transtensional model is suggested for the Taubate Basin to explain some of its principal geological features

By specifying appropriately the conservation constants and boundary conditions of the effective potential function, the integral curves yield, respectively, three types of solutions: Nonlinear Langmuir waves, ion-acoustic solitons, and double layers. The similarities and differences of the existence conditions for these nonlinear potential structures are discussed

   83:  This paper reviews theoretical research on the solar corona performed in Brazil. Three coronal processes are discussed: (1) coronal heating by surface Alfven waves, (2) coronal heating by global Alfven waves, and (3) generation of type III radio emission. The surface Alfven waves can power, directly, at least 10
   83:   of the required coronal flux density; in the case of mode conversion into kinetic Alfven waves the bulk of energy flux density can be provided. The global waves can power at least 20
   83:   of the required coronal energy flux density. It is shown that the electromagnetic oscillating two-stream instability driven by intense Langmuir waves, can be a likely generation mechanism of type-III radio bursts

   83:  About 15 years after quantitative models were presented on magnetopause reconnection involving a tilted reconnection line accross the magnetopause's stagnation-subsolar region [Gonzalez and Mozer, 1974; Sonnerup, 1974; Hill, 1975], it was interesting to see the recent work by Crooker et al. [1990] (hereinafter C et al.) in which they try to extend the above mentioned models toward a more globally defined reconnection line. However the following comments seem necessary

I will attempt here to address complementary aspects of both types of models, with the goal of moving toward a unified model of magnetopause reconnection

Such studies assume that this passage has two subintervals with Bz pointing south first and then north (SN or "negative" clouds) or vice versa (NS or "positive" clouds). Using this classification scheme, these authors have explored important aspects of the geomagnetic response to magnetic clouds

   83:  The concentration of atmosphere carbon monoxide, CO, was measured in the Amazonian rain forest. Air samples were collected at least three times a day during a continuous sequence of 36 days, from a height of 1.5 m above the ground. These surface CO measurements were part of a large binational field expedition to the Brazilian Amazon Region, the ABLE 2B mission, a joint American-Brazilian effort to measure local concentrations of several species relevant to atmospheric chemistry. The time period of this experiment was April-May of 1987, in the local wet season. The measurement technique used was chromatographic separation followed by mercury vapor detection. The surface CO measurements obtained represent a comprehensive CO data set, unique in that the concentrations were measured immediately after collection, by a measurement system installed next to the sampling sites. The CO lab was set up at Ducke Forest Reserve, some 30 km north of the city of Manaus (3 degrees S, 60 degrees W). The results show a small but consistant diurnal variation of the CO concentration, with a maximum around noon. The average CO mixing ratio for the period was 102.9+-11.4 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), with most samples giving concentrations between 95 and 105 ppbv. On six occasions in April, large CO concentrations were observed during relatively short periods, and these were classified as pollution episodes associated with unusual wind conditions which probably brought air into the forest that had contact with the city of Manaus. No such episodes were seen during May. Simultaneous sampling inside the forest, under the canopy, and in the Duke Forest clearing, show larger concentrations in the forest, by a few ppbv. This result is consistent with the direct measurement of the CO profile below the forest canopy, which gave a concentration gradient consistent with an upward flux of 4 x 10 11 CO molecules cm-2 s-1

   83:  Carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) concentrations have been observed in the Brazilian Amazon region, at a site strongly affected by biomass burning (Cuiaba, 16 degrees S, 58 degrees W). Time variations are described for the first longterm program for studying the effect of biomass burning on O3 and CO over a complete seasonal cycle, including the seasonal maxima of 1987 and 1988. Concentrations of O3 are measured continuously, and CO samples are collected three times a week. In order to obtain elements for comparison, an identical observational program was maintained at a site totally outside of the direct influence of biomass burning (Natal, 6 degrees S, 35 degrees W). The biomass burning contribution to the Cuiaba concentrations of CO and O3 is very large. Diurnal maximum concentrations exceeded 90 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) O3 in 1987 and 120 ppbv O3 in 1988, in September. For the wet season, the monthly average ozone concentration in March-April is about 10 ppbv. During the month of maxima, September, the O3 concentration average was 41 ppbv for 1987 and 71 ppbv for 1988. The CO concentrations are about 90 ppbv in the wet season. In September, 460 ppbv and 660 ppbv of CO were observed for 1987 and 1988, respectively. At Natal the seasonal variaton is of the order of a factor of 2. For the biomass burning site this factor is 4 for 1987 and almost 7 for 1988. In contrast, during the wet season, the concentrations of CO and O3 at both stations are about the same

   83:  The concentration of atmospheric ozone was measured in the Amazoniam rain forest. Observations were made almost continuously at the surface, and in addition, 20 ozone profiles were obtained in the troposphere and stratosphere. These ozone measurements were part of a field expedition to the Brazilian Amazon region, the ABLE 2B mission, a joint American-Brazilian effort to measure local concentrations of several species, relevant to atmospheric chemistry. The time period of this expedition was April-May 1987, during the local wet season. For the surface ozone data the measurement technique used was UV absorption. Ozone profiles were obtained with electrochemical concentration cell sondes, launched on balloons. The major site of operaton was set up near Manaus (3 degrees S, 60 degrees W). The results are presented and compared with a previous dry season experiment. Surface ozone mixing ratios show diurnal variations that have maxima in the daytime and minima at night. The diurnal maximum at noontime, considered very low (12 ppbv) in the dry season was even lower in this wet season period (6 ppbv). A significant difference can be seen between clearing and forest data, and between different height levels above the surface, showing the existence of a large positive gradient of ozone with height. The ozone profiles in the troposphere show that there is less ozone not only at the surface but in the whole troposphere, with the wet season average showing between 6 and 12 ppbv less ozone. This difference is much smaller in the stratosphere, where there is slightly more ozone in the region of the peak, during the wet season. An isolated shower or thunderstorm in the dry season could produce transient ozone variations (mixing ratio increases or decreases) that were not observed in the wet season

   83:  Measurements of ozone (O3) and aerosols were made over the tropical rain forest of Brazil during ther wet season in April-May 1987 as part of tha NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment to study the Amazon boundary layer. Remote and in situ measurements of O3 and aerosols  were made from aircraft on flights over Brazil in the vicinity of Manaus and between Manaus and Belem. Ozonesonde data were also obtained near Manaus. Ozone mixing ratios <12 ppbv were found in the mixed layer during the wet season with no significant evidence of O3  produced from biomass burning or photochemistry. These values are lower than those found during the 1985 dry season by 6-8 ppbv. These low O3 mixing ratios indicate a strong removal process near the surface during the wet season. The region from the mixed layer top to 3 km in altitude had a slowly increasing O3 profile from 12 to 20 ppbv. On long-range flights between Manaus and Belem, no significant difference was found in the distribution of O3 above the mixed layer between the inland tropical rain forest and the marine conditions near the coast. Within the mixed layer, there was a definite trend to lower O3 levels above the forest compared to over the ocean. This reflects the marked difference in the sinks for O3 over these two regions. The rate of growth of the mixed layer over the rain forest in the wet season was found to be 9 cm s-1, which is within the 7-10 cm s-1 range found for the dry season. There was no evidence of the trade wind inversion that was seen during the dry season, and due to frequent precipitation, the background aerosol loading was lower in the wet season than in the dry season

   83:  Field observations obtained during the second NASA Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 2B), and two-dimensional moist cloud model simulations are used to determine the dominant transport pathways within a continental tropical squall line. A surface-based network triangle provided the focus for a multi-instrumental sampling of the May 6, 1987, squall line which propagated through the central Amazon basin at a rate of 40-50 km h-1. Extensive use is made of the vertical distribution of specific trace gases that are representative of the prestorm and poststorm environment. One-dimensional photochemical model results suggest the observed poststorm changes in ozone concentration can be attributed to convective transports rather than photochemical production. Two-dimensional cloud model results detail the dynamic and thermodynamic attributes of the simulated squall convection. The well-mixed moist troposphere in which the observed squall system developed may have hindered strong downdraft development. Parcel trajectory analyses are conducted to investigate the flow patterns of convective transports. A significant proportion (>50) of the air transported to the anvil region originated at or above 6 km, not from the boundary layer via undilute cores. The presence of a midlevel inflow and a strong melting layer at 5.5 km reduced the vertical development of the core updraft and aided in the maintenance of a rotor circulation. The predicted absence of more than one active cell in the model cloud field, the lack of a well-organized downdraft in the presence of model estimated net upward mass flux, and the initial wind profile suggest the May 6 squall line was unicell in character

   83:  The manual harvest of sugar cane requires the burning of its foliage. This burning has strongly increased in Brazil after the National Alcohol Program was started which substituted automobile gasoline engines for alcohol engines. Presently, the source strenght per unit area of this rural pollution is comparable to the well-known biomass burning source in Amazonia. The observd concentrations of CO and O3 in the rural area of the state of Sao Paulo during the 1988 burning season were twice as large as those reported from an aircraft experiment of 1985 for biomass burnings of the tropical rain forest. Results are reported from airplane measurements and from three fixed ground stations. Mixing ratios of ozone and carbon monoxide in the height range below 6 km are normally less than 40 and 100 ppbv (parts per billion by volume), respectively, in the absence of burnings. A strong O3 and CO layer was observed during the burning period with peak concentrations of 80 ppbv of ozone and 580 ppbv of CO at about 2 km. The concentrations of CH4 and CO2 were also large, 1756 ppbv and 409 ppmv, respectively, at 1500 m. During the dry season period of the experiment, the ground based based O3 average diurnal variations obtained at the rural sites were practically identical to the typical urban variation observed at Sao Jose dos Campos, with daytime ozone values between 45 and 60 ppbv. A second three-day airplane excursion to the sugar cane fields in the wet season of 1989 has produces results to be contrasted with the dry (burning) season of 1988 and 1989.  Carbon monoxide concentrations were below 100 ppbv at all heights and ozone concentrations were around 30-40 ppbv. The maximum daytime concentrations at the ground station Bauru was 25 ppbv of O3, and at Jaboticabal it was 35 ppbv of O3, only one half of what was observed in the dry season

   83:  Results are presented from analysis of a large ozone profile data set obtained from balloon ozonesonde soundings made at Natal, Brazil (6 degrees S, 35 degrees W) during the last 10 years (1978-1988). The measurements have been made through an Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE)/NASA long-term collaboration program. The balloons were released by the Brazilian Air Force at the Natal rocket range. The data set is sufficiently large to provide useful climatology on the average ozone concentration behavior and its seasonal variation. The day-to-day ozone concentration variability in the troposphere is rather large, giving standard deviations of about 30-40
   83:   for seasonal averages. Maximum ozone concentrations occur during local spring, September-October, and minimum concentrations during late autumn, April-May. The seasonal variation in the troposphere is much larger than in the stratosphere. If there were no seasonal variation at all in the stratosphere, the seasonal variation observed in the troposphere alone would be strong enough to drive a total ozone column variation of about 5
   83:  , which is about one half the size of the variation observed in the Natal Dobson spectrophometer data. The ozone concentration at Natal increases with height between the surface and about 500 mbar, almost linearly, from about 15 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) to about 38 ppbv, in autumn. For the spring average the ozone concentration increases from about 25 ppbv at the surface to about 66 ppbv at 500 mbar. The sonde data suggest that limitations in aneroid pressure sensors used until 1986 caused the Natal sondes to indicate too much ozone above 6 mbar. Because of the relative sparsity and uneven distribution in time of the ozone soundings, the data are not adequate to study ozone trends. The Dobson data time series shows no definitive ozone trend but displays a pronounced quai-biennial oscillation in ozone

Foram realizadas varias campanhas de campo na superficie e no ar, a bordo de um aviao Bandeirante instrumentado, na regiao canavieira do Estado de Sao Paulo. Efeitos muito expressivos foram observados nas concentracoes de CO e O3. Na epoca chuvosa quando nao ha queimadas as concentracoes ate 6 km de altitude sao menores que 30 ppbv (partes por bilhao por volumes), para o O3 e cerca de 100 ppbv para o CO. Na epoca de queimada de palha de cana (setembro) foram observadas concentracoes de ate 80 ppbv a cerca de 1,5 km de altitude para o O3, e 600 ppbv para o CO. Deve-se notar que estas medidas foram feitas a varios quilometros de distancia das fontes poluidoras, para caracterizar o estado medio da atmosfera inferior em equilibrio. Estima-se que somente no Estado de Sao Paulo as queimadas da cana injetam na atmosfera cerca de 350.000 toneladas de carbono na forma de CO

   83:  A nonlinear emission mechanism of electromagnetic waves at the fundamental plasma frequency has been examined by Chian  Alves. This mechanism is based on the electromagnetic oscillating two-stream instability driven by two oppositely propagating Langmuir waves. The excitation of the electromagnetic oscillating two-stream instability is due to nonlinear wave-wave coupling involving Langmuir waves, low-frequency density waves and electromagnetic waves. In this paper the Chian  Alves  model is improved using the generalized Zakharov equations. Attention is directed toward the influence of induced low-frequency and Langmuir waves on the properties of the electromagnetic oscillating two-stream instability. Presumably, the properties derived in the present context may be relavant to both space and laboratory plasmas

   83:  The problem of downward mapping of equatorial ionospheric electric fields is studied in two dimensions employing the finite elements and finite differences numerical techniques. The solutions obtained for low latitudes are compared with known results for high latitudes. It is found that equatorial ionospheric electric fields of scale lengths of the order of 100 km or more reach balloon heights (30-40 km) without undergoing noticeable attenuation. However, in the case of equatorial ionospheric electric fields of scale lengths of a few tens of kilometers it is found that these fields reach balloon heigths with severe attenuation. The corresponding attenuation factors are significantly larger than those known for high latitudes. It is also shown that the presence of mountains with a fairly large height as well as of a large-scale conductivity irregularity in the middle atmosphere, such as  that expected in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA) region during energetic electron precipitation events, can considerably distort the mapped ionospheric electric fields at the middle atmosphere

   83:  This review deals with the interplanetary-magnetosphere coupling during intense geomagnetic activity near solar maximum as learned from the ISEE-3 satellite. For this purpose we use the plasma and magnetic field measurements obtained by this satellite during the interval of August 1978 to December 1979, when it was at the L1 libration point of the sun-earth system. During this interval nine out the ten intense geomagnetic storms (Peak Dst < -100nT) were preceded by the arrival of interplanetary fast forward shocks at 1AU. For these events we show the interplanetary structures that are associated with the large-amplitude and long-duration negative Bz fields that were found in the sheath and/or driver gas regions of the shock and that are thought to be main cause of the intense storms. The storm that was not preceded by a shock was found to be associated with a non compressive density enhancement (NCDE) event. On the other hand, during this same interval, "High-Intensity, Long-Duration and Continuous Auroral Activity" events (HILDCAAs for short) were found to be caused by the southward magnetic fields of large-amplitude interplanetary Alfven Waves, presumably through magnetic reconnection with the geomagnetic field. Observations at the L1 point are also of great importance for studies of solar-interplanetary coupling. Thus with respect to the intense geomagnetic storms of the ISEE-3 monitored interval, new hints about the solar origin of these storms are also addressed. With respect to geomagnetic storm predictability we emphasize the need to have a satellite at the L1 point, such as ISEE-3, continuously monitoring the solar wind, as perhaps the only reliable tool at the moment

   83:  The five largest magnetic storms that occurred between 1971 to 1986 are studied to determine their solar and interplanetary causes. All of the events are found to be associated with high speed solar wind streams led by collisionless shocks. The high speed streams are clearly related to identifiable solar flares. It is found that: 1) it is the extreme values of the southward interplanetary magnetic fields rather than solar wind speeds that are the primary causes of great magnetic storms, 2) shocked and draped sheath fields preceding the driver gas (magnetic cloud) are at least as effective in causing the onset of great magnetic storms (3 of 5 events) as the strong fields within the driver gas itself, and 3) precursor southward fields ahead of the high speed streams allow the shock compression mechanism (item 2) to be particularly geoeffective

Lanzerotti quotes a value of DST of only - 125 nT for the August 5 event. Anderson et al. (1974) speculated that the geomagnetic disturbance may have been caused by large magnetopause currents which were highly distorted (displaced to much lower latitudes). This effect was due to unusually high solar wind speeds

   83:  Tropospheric ozone measurements are described from observations made at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz (62.1 degrees S, 58.4 degrees W). Ozone measurements at the surface were made almost continuously during several years, using ultraviolet absortion photometers. In the upper troposphere, ozone concentrations were obtained using balloon sondes, launched in the summer of 1991 and between March and October, 1992. Surface ozone concentrations show strong variations each year. The minimum monthly average occurs in February, 11.7 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and the maximum in July, 29.6 ppbv. There is no apparent diurnal variation. Sporadic fast decreases in ozone are associated with synoptic scale perturbations during front passages, when the ozone mixing ratio may drop by 10-20 ppbv for about 6 hours or more. The ozonesonda data show a well-defined local mixing layer. The ozone mixing ratio does not change at the upper boundary of the mixing layer, indicating little or no photochemical activity. The mixing ratio follows a vertical distribution with a small positive gradient of about 2.5 ppbv/km

   83:  Very large fires can be seen every year during the local dry seasons, in the Brazilian Amazon region. These fires do not only scar the surface, but also appreciably modify the composition of the lower atmosphere, by the production of several gases. Since the occurrence of the fires is so strongly dependent on the season, a dry-wet season map of strategic geographic locations of Brazil is given, defining quantitatively these periods, using climatological means of temperature and precipitation rates. It becomes clear how different these regimes are, varying from no dry season at all in the far northwest Amazon forest, to the intermediate mid year dry season period of central Brazil, up to the unusually dry areas of the Brazilian northeast. Ozone (O3), produced indirectly in the atmosphere, has been systematically observed at strategic locations in Amazonia (and a control site, outside the burning area, for comparison) for several years. Ozone and carbon monoxide concentrations vary seasonally following similar patterns, with high concentrations in the dry season and low concentrations in the wet season. The ratio between these extremes has been observed to be as high as a factor of 7 for CO and 4 for O3, for monthly averages. In contrast, the comparison with results from the control site show no significant differences between stations in the wet season period, but excess ozone of about 30 p.p.b.v. can be seen in the dry season. Measurements of the ozone vertical distribution reveal occasional highly concentrated layers of tropospheric ozone or high ozone loadings in the whole troposphere.

   83:  O ozonio, considerado o protetor dos seres vivos contra os efeitos danosos da radiacao ultravioleta solar, tem tambem seu lado "vilao". Para esse gas natural ser biologicamente favoravel ou nao so depende de sua altura na atmosfera. Na chamada  camada de ozonio, a cerca de 30 km da superficie, ja na estratosfera, ele e "bom", porque filtra a radiacao perigosa. Porem na baixa atmosfera, a historia muda. Concentracoes elevadas desse oxigenio trimolecular (O3), em especial se proximas a superficie, prejudicam o desenvolvimento das plantas. Ai, ele e o ozonio "ruim". Nesse enredo, o homem e um justiceiro as avessas: suas atividades industriais e suas queimadas reduzem o ozonio "bom" e aumentam o "ruim", formador de grandes manchas na baixa atmosfera. Uma cooperacao cientifica internacional vai estudar melhor esse fenomeno. Pesquisadores brasileiros estarao operando na regiao central e na costa brasileira, os norte-americanos sobrevoarao o Atlantico Sul, e os cientistas alemaes, franceses e africanos farao um trabalho de campo na Africa

   83:  The second worshop TRACE-A Brazil intends to evaluate the progress of the mission to date and program the major experiment for September. Project TRACE-A proposes to perform a major field experiment in the region of the South-Atlantic, the Brazilian coast, and the African coast, to make atmospheric chemistry measurements in the troposphere. Atmospheric chemistry, in this context, includes a number of disciplines with a broad interest in the Atmosphere, especially in Chemistry, Physics, Meteorology, Particles, and Biological aspects. The major interest of TRACE-A Brazil will consist of observations in the Brazilian sector, but keeping in mind the international cooperation character. The basic idea is that the South-Atlantic will be investigated by American scientists on board the NASA DC-8. In Africa, scientists from Germany, France, and Africa will be active. Operations in Brazil will include ground based activity for surface measurements, vertical soundings, and instrumented aircraft flights with the INPE and FUNCEME Bandeirantes

   83:  The summer monsoon rainfall time series for 29 subdivisions of India from 1951 to 1991 (41 years) were subjected to maximum entropy spectral analysis and showed significant periodicities in a wide range, including quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO 2-3 years) and quasi-triennial oscillation (QTO 3-3.9 years). After filtering out periodicities of 4.0 years or more, the residual series, considered as representative of QBO and QTO only for each series, could be separated into 4 categories (viz., category A of 10 subdivisions having only one strong QBO peak but no QTO, category B of 4 subdivisions having two strong QBO peaks but no QTO, category C of 4 subdivisions having no strong QBO or QTO, and category D of 11 subdivisions having a strong QTO). The 50 mb zonal wind showed two strong QBO peaks at 2.33 years (28 m) and 2.75 years (33 m). A comparison of stratospheric (50 mb) westerly wind and rainfall maxima showed that for many  subdivisions, maximum rainfall was associated with the increasing westerly phase of zonal wind and droughts were associated with the easterly phase. A loose relationship with El Nino-Southern Oscillation was also noticed for droughts in some subdivisions (mostly western India), and the two effects (50-mb wind and ENSO) seem to be operating independently of each other

   83:  The annual mean sunspot number time series for the period 1700-1990 A.D. was examined for possible fitting with exponential functions of the form N=No.exp(kt) for each phase, where the values of k, analogous to probabilities, are positive for the rising phase and negative for declining phase. The results obtained suggest the participation of physical processes following macroscopic laws similar to those of explosion or nuclear divergence for sunspot production and of nuclear decay for sunspot disappearance

   83:  In a previous communication, the annual mean sunspot number time series for the period 1700-1990 A.D. was studied through fitting with exponential functions of the form N=No.exp(kt) for each phase. In this letter every solar cycle is reduced to five characteristic parameters: exponents K and observed durations for the rising and declining phases and values of the maximum. The periodicities between 50 and 200 yr for these five parameters are analyzed and compared between themselves, showing similar patterns (dominating periodicities at about 59 and 86 yr) and differences such as different periods for the exponent of the rising (83.5 yr) and declining (105 yr) phase and for the observed maximum (99 yr)

   83:  Three scalar AMT campaigns were conducted in the mid-summer, late-fall, and late-winter seasons of 1990 in two nearby localities of southern Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Comparisons of the results obtained at each season highlighted the problem of seasonal variation in the apparent resistivity measurements in the area. From 1-D inversions, the most striking fact in this temporal variation is the presence, in the last two campaigns of a new deeper conductive layer (conductance of 6 to 7 S) at depths of the order of 500 m, which was not observed in the mid-summer campaign. Careful observation of the regional rainfall data indicated that the seasonal conductive layer could be generated by the occurrence of a transitory deep aquifer that would grow or wane in time in accordance to the climatological conditions. Another likely explanation could be in terms of a misinterpretation of the geoelectrical section due to the distortion of the MT curves by induction effects generated by a saturated surficial layer

   83:  A magnetotelluric survey consisting of fifteen high-frequency AMT and six low frequency MT soundings was carried out in the intraplate seismic province of northeast Brazil. A NW-SE profile with nine AMT and four MT stations was positioned to cross the seismic zone of Joao Camara (5.5 degrees S, 35.7 degrees W) which is the easternmost swarm of the NE province. Two conductive layers were derived from 2D modelling of the TM-mode of electromagnetic wave propagation: 1. a shallower one (depth of 10 km) in the NW-end of the profile with conductance of 60 S, and 2, a deeper one (at 30 km) in the SE-end. Preliminary interpretation of these results suggests that the crustal conductivity structure of the region could be controlled by unexpected temperature differences between conterminous crustal blocks. In the western block are concentrated the principal upper crust geophysical and geological inhomogeneities and the most important recent shallow-depth seismic activity. The 10 km deep conductive layer in this block could be possible associated with a ductile layer which limits the maximum depht of the earthquakes

   83:  Eight magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were performed as a continuation of an earlier audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) survey conducted in the northeastern border of the Parana basin, a large intracratonic basin located in central eastern South America and constituted by Silurian to Jurassic sedimentary rocks with Lower Cretaceous sill-type magmatic intrusions and overlying volcanics. Two of the MT stations were carried out near two deep petroleum wells. The remaining MT soundings were done on a profile traversing two important gravity features: a positive anomaly near the border of the states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais and a strong (trending NW-SE) linear gradient. Major findings of an integrated interpretation of the MT survey and of available gravity data are as follows: (1) inhomogeneities and/or strong magnetization of the superficial volcanics and diabase intrusions in the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks appearing to distort the MT results; (2) identification of important structural discontinuities, including a possible different crustal structure beneath the Parana basin compared to the region on the north, a thickening of the crust toward the NE, and the probable existence of a through (graben?) within the basin, characterized by a thick accumulation of sediments and basalts

   83:  One of the oldest mysteries in geomagnetism is the linkage between solar and geomagnetic activity. In 1852, it was first noted that both the numbers of sunspots and geomagnetic storms at Earth have an 11 year cycle. A few years later, it was noted that a large magnetic storm followed the great September 1859 solar flare and a causal relationship between flares and storms was speculated. It was not until this century that a well-accepted statistical survey on large solar flares and geomagnetic storms was performed. The results indicated that a significant correlation between flares and geomagnetic storms exist

   83:  The monthly and daily samples of the Ap geomagnetic index for 51 years, 1932-1982, were investigated by means of the power spectrum technique. In general, the results confirm previous findings about possible periodicities in the geomagnetic activity. However, in our opinion the following aspects are either new or they are being interpreted somewhat differently than other authors have done. The period around 4 years in the monthly Ap power spectrum is associated to the double peak structure observed in the geomagnetic activity variation [Gonzalez et al., 1990]. Several of the peaks shown by the daily Ap spectrum are interpreted as harmonics of the 6-month period and other peaks as caused by the solar rotation periodicity, in such a way that the two series of Fourier sequences are consider to be juxtaposed. A strong solar cycle modulation is observed in these series, particularly in that related to the solar rotation period, which almost disappears for the solar maximum phase. The study of the seasonal variation was complemented by a superposed epoch analysis. The profiles resulting from this analysis seem to show a multiple origin of the 6-month periodicity, so that it does not seem realistic to search for a unique cause for this well-known seasonal variation. This conclusion is also supported by the histograms of the occurrence of storms above a given intensity level, taken over short duration intervals (i.e., 8 days). According to these histograms, for large data samples the dates with largest number of storms are spread out around those predicted by the different theoretical models, while for short intervals the semiannual periodicity may sometimes not even be present. Therefore these known mechanisms would combine to give a resulting modulation of the geomagnetic response to the randomly generated source of storms. It was also found that an additional seasonal peak seems to exist in July, with an amplitude comparable to those of the equinoctial peaks, for the range of the most intense storms (Ap>-150 nT). A weak periodicity around 158 days, well correlated to that of about 155 days observed in the solar activity, has also been detected for some years during solar cycle 21

   83:  This paper reports the overall experimental design and gives a brief overview of results from the third airborne Chemical Instrumentation Test and Evaluation (CITE 3) mission conducted as part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Global Tropospheric Experiment. The primary objective of CITE 3 was to evaluate the capability of instrumentation for airbone measurements of ambient concentrations of SO2, H2S, CS2, dimethyl sulfide, and carbonyl sulfide. Ancillary measuremants augmented the intercomparison data in order to address the secondary objective of CITE 3 which was to address specific issues related to the budget and photochemistry of tropospheric sulfur species. The CITE 3 mission was conducted on NASA's Wallops Flight Center Electra aircraft and included a ground-based intercomparison of sulfur standards and intercomparison/sulfur science flights conducted from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia, followed by flights from Natal, Brazil. Including the transits flights, CITE 3 included 16 flights encompassing approximately 96 flight hours

   83:  To reduce the effect of randomness as well as of local characteristics, rainfall data for subregions of NE Brazil were combined. The resulting series (1913-1977) was smoother and showed some general characteristics like excess rainfall during 1917, 1921, 1924, 1964, 1974 and droughts during 1915, 1919, 1932, 1953, 1958. However, these and other events seemed to occur irregularly. A spectral analysis showed significant periodicities near T = 2-3, 3-4, 5-6, 13, 26 and 50 years. But their contribution to total variance was only about 55

Em Rodeio Velho, as sondagens confirmam a presenca de centenas de metros de sedimentos, provavelmente afetados por estruturas verticais e alternancia de camadas resistiva e condutora. Na regiao de Santa Maria, as sondagens nas areas mineralizadas apresentaram uma camada intermediaria mais condutora, que aproximadamente coincide com a posicao de camada mineralizada

Near the critical layer of an underdense plasma where the incident laser frequency is close to the local plasma frequency, coupling of unstable electromagnetic and electrostatic modes may occur. The transition from purely electromagnetic and purely electrostatic instabilities to hybrid instabilities is analysed using the generalized Zakharov equations

   83:  The parametric instabilities driven by a standing Alfven wave of circular polarization are studied. Above a certain threshold amplitude, a standing Alfven wave can generate convective or purely growing MHD parametric processes. It is shown that the threshold conditions can be satisfied by the ULF waves in the planetary magnetospheres. Large density flutuations and cavities may result from the ponderomotive interaction of Alfven and acoustic waves. Application of this theory to the observation of Alfven-acoustic turbulence in the Earth's auroral plasma is dicussed

   83:  A novel generation mechanism of nonthermal electromagnetic radiation near the electron plasma frequency by Langmuir waves in space and astrophysical plasmas is proposed. It is shown that large amplitude Langmuir waves may nonlinearly interact with Alfven waves to generate electromagnetic waves. This radiation mechanism may explain the excitation of whistler-mode emission in the Earth's and Jupiter's auroral acceleration regions where the electron plasma frequency is smaller than the electron cyclotron  frequency. Observational evidence in support of the proposed emission mechanism is discussed

   83:  A new excitation mechanism of auroral Langmuir and Alfven waves in the planetary magnetosphere is proposed. It is shown that a large-amplitude electromagnetic whistler wave propagating along the magnetic field lines can nonlinearly  generate Langmuir and Alfven waves through three-wave parametric instabilities, provided the interacting waves satisfy the phase matching and wave helicity conservation conditions. The proposed mechanism can account for the observation of Langmuir-Alfven-whistler (LAW) auroral events in the Earth's magnetosphere. It is suggested that similar parametric processes are likely to occur in the other field-aligned current regions of astrophysical plasmas wherein the electron plasma frequency is of the order of or less than the electron cyclotron frequency

   83:  We show that the ponderomotive coupling of electrostatic Langmuir parametric instabilities and electromagnetic filamentation instability can occur in the vicinity of the reflection level where the frequency of the high power heater radio wave, injected into space plasmas by active experiments, is near the local plasma frequency. In general, the heater-generated parametric instabilities are not purely electrotastic or electromagnetic in the proximity of the critical density, but become hybrid (coupled electrostatic-electromagnetic) modes. As a result, the growth rate and bandwidth of the parametric decay line are significantly modified by the electromagnetic effects

   83:  After a brief review of magnetospheric and interplanetary phenomena for intervals with enhanced solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, an attempt is made to define a geomagnetic storm as an interval of time when a sufficiently intense and long-lasting interplanetary convection electric field leads, through a substantial energization in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, to an intensified ring current sufficiently strong to exceed some key thresold of the quantifying storm time Dst index. The associated storm/substorm relationship problem is also reviewed. Although the physics of this relationship does not seem to be fulled understood at this time, basic and fairly well stablished mechanisms of the relationship are presented and discussed. Finally, toward the advancement of geomagnetic storm research, some recommendations are given concerning future improvements in monitoring existing geomagnetic indices as well as the solar wind near Earth

   83:  After correcting for seasonal variations and long-term (linear or quadratic) trends, the residual interannual anomalies (variations) of the trace elements and surface aerosol show periodicities in the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (2-3 years) and 3-5 years range. Quasi-biennial Oscillations (QBO) of some elements match with the QBO of equatorial 50-hPa wind, but for some others, matching is not good. For some elements, matching with Southern Oscillation index is good. The relationship is probably through the sea-surface temperature changes, which affect the role of the ocean as a source/sink for these trace elements. Interaction between equatorial wind QBO and extratropical phenomena should also be involved

However, low latitudes, even in the Northern Hemisphere may have some effect of the Antarctic ozone hole

   83:  The evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole is illustrated for 1985-1990 springs. A detailed study for 1986-1989 and 1990 events indicates that the evolution, which occurs in early October, is fairly uniform over the South Pole. Hence the fluctuations observed at Syowa, McMurdo and Palmer during this period are mostly due to the vortex wall passing in and out over these periferial locations. However, later in November when the hole is dissipating, the vortex may shift from the South Pole in any direction and may also come back or intensify on South Pole before finally disappearing. At South Pole, the recovery started by October end in 1985, 1986 and 1988 but later in 1987 (November end), 1989 (November beginning) and 1990 (November end)

The portion 0 - 800 ka B.P. showed 95,000 years as the strongest peak, resembling the 98,000 year peak in the spectra of oxygen isotope series from deep-sea cores, and matching the eccentricity peak of Earth's rotation axis. The astronomical peaks 19,000 and 23,000 years related to Earth's precession and 41,000 years related to Earth's obliquity were also observed but weakly. For earlier periods (800 ka - 2400 ka B.P.), nine peaks were observed (including 41,000 and 100,000 years) but weakly

   83:  Several field expeditions were organized in recent years to study modifications introduced into the lower atmosphere of the Amazon region, as a result of anthropogenic influence. In a simplified way, the legal Brazilian Amazon is formed by the rainforest ecosystem in the north and west, and the savanna (cerrado) in the central region. The frontier region between these two quite different types of vegetation is where most burning occurs, and due to the large areas and amounts of phytomas involved these burnings may represent sources of Global importance. This report describes enhancements of atmospheric ozone concentrations in the remote cerrado troposphere which are believed to result from biomass burning activity. The measurements were obtained in two filed expeditions to the Brazilian cerrado region of central Brazil, an area subject to cyclic burning, during the local dry season. Ozone concentrations are known to increase in the burning season. However, this process is normally a gradual increase over the season and proportional at all heights. Occasionally, large layer enhancements are seen. Three such cases are discussed, showing concentrations of ozone between 80 and 120 ppbv (parts per billion by volume), when normal averages are about 60 ppbv. To our knowledge this is the first time that such large concentrations were observed in areas of biomass burning. In one event the ozone mixing ratio was increased in a layer near 800 mbar (2.0 km above ground) to a maximum of 112 ppbv, when the known maximum observed near this height was 80 ppbv. Other events show a layer near 250 mbar (10.9 km above ground) reaching 120 and 122 ppbv at the peak. It is believed that these are special events which could be produced by a coincidence of chemical production and dynamical layering effects

   83:  Various types of soil samples were collected in the southern part of Brazil, with depth intervals of 5 cm, down to 50 cm, using a specially designed sampler. Pedological analysis of these soils were performed. Nuclear activities of Cs (expressed in Bq m-2) and radioactive natural element (Ra, Ra and K) concentrations were determined by low background gamma-ray spectometry. Cs concentrations were correlated with radioactive natural element concentrations and pedological, climatological and geographic parameters related to the soil samples collected

Pedological analyses were practiced on these samples and Cs an Th, Ra and K activities were determined by gamma-ray spectometry. A latitude dependence of Cs was found as well. It was impossible to determine the Cs contribution from Chernobyl nuclear accident because of low fallout and intense leaching, erosion and re-suspension in soils of regions with high annual precipitation. Natural radionuclides did not show such effects

   83:  One of the oldest mysteries in geomagnetism is the linkage between solar and geomagnetic activity. The 11-year cycles of both the numbers of sunspots and Earth geomagnetic storms were first noted by Sabine [1852]. A few years late, speculation on a causal relationship between flares and storms arose when Carrington [1859] reported that a large magnetic storm followed the great September 1859 solar flare. However, it was not until this century that a well-accepted statistical survey on large solar flares and geomagnetic storms was performed [Newton, 1943], and a significant correlation between flares and geomagnetic storms was noted

   83:  A new theory is proposed to explain the temporal variation of the dispersion measure of pulsars. In view of the extremely high values of the observed radio luminosity, the pulsar radio waves in the vicinity of the source region within a pulsar magnetosphere obey a nonlinear dispersion relation which depends on the pulse amplitude. Hence the observed DM variations might be due to the influence of the pulse amplitude on the dispersion relation. It is shown that there is a correlation between the DM fluctuation and the radio luminosity, suggesting that the variations of the pulse intensity may be one of the important causes of DM fluctuations

   83:  Nonlinear saturation of unstable solutions to the weakly relativistic, one-dimensional Zakharov equations is considered in this paper. In order to perform the analysis, two quantities are introduced. One of them ro*, is proportional to the initial energy of the high frequency field, and the other is the basic wave vector of the low frequency perturbing mode k= 2pi/L, with L as the length scale. With these quantities it becomes possible to identify a number of regions on a ro* versus k parametric plane. For very small values of ro*, steady-state solutions become unstable when k is also very small. In this case ion-acoustic dynamics is found to be unimportant and the system is numerically shown to be approximately integrable, even if k is below a critical value where the solutions are not simply periodic. For larger values of ro* the unstable wave vectors also become larger and the ion-acoustic fluctuations turn into active dynamical modes of the system, driving a transition to chaos, which follows initial inverse pitchfork bifurcations. The transition includes resonant and quasiperiodic features; separatrix crossing phenomena are also found. The influence of relativistic terms on the chaotic dynamics is studied in the context of the Zakharov equations; it is shown that relativistic terms is generally enhance the instabilities of the system, therefore anticipating the transition

In order to interpret these observations, a coherent nonlinear analysis of three-wave processes is performed for both electrostatic and electromagnetic Langmuir decay processes. The Manley-Rowe relations that relate energy levels of the interacting waves are derived, which show that the ion-acoustic wave energy is much less than the Langmuir wave energy. Analytical expressions describing the nonlinearly modulated Langmuir wave packets are obtained. The nonlinear modulation period is shown to be a function of the wave amplitude

   83:  We examined 11 cases when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was intensely northward (>10 nT) for long durations of time (>3 hours), to quantitatively determine an upper limit on the efficiency of solar wind energy injection into the magnetosphere. We have specifically selected these large BN events to minimize the effects of magnetic reconnection. Many of these cases occurred during intervals of high-speed streams associated with coronal mass ejections when viscous interacton effects might be at a maximum. It is found that the typical efficiency of solar wind energy injection into the magnetosphere is 1.0 x 10 -3 to 4.0 x 10 -3, 100 to 30 times less efficient than during periods of intense southward IMFs. Other energy sinks not included in the numbers are discussed. Estimates of their magnitudes are provided

This review article will not attempt to cover all of the work done during this period. This can be found elsewhere. Our emphasis here will be on recent efforts that expose important, presently unanswered questions that must be addressed and solved before true predictability of storms can be possible. Hopefully, this article will encourage some readers to join this effort and perhaps make major contributions to the field

   83:  Spectral analysis of daily values of various solar indices viz. sunspot number, 10.7-cm flux, H Lyman-alfa and -beta, specific He, Fe and Mg lines and solar X-rays was carried out for two selected intervals. During interval A (May-August 1978, 123 days) the solar indices showed a prominent periodicity near 27 days, while during interval B (January-May 1979, 151 days) the solar indices showed a prominent periodicity near 13 days. For the same intervals, foF2 (max) and foF2 (average) during 1000-1500 LT were similarity analysed for the locations Cachoeira Paulista, SP, Brazil (23 degrees S, 45 degrees W) and Okinawa (26 degrees N, 128 degrees E) and Kokubunji (36 degrees N, 139 degrees E) in Japan. The 27-day and 13-day periodicities in solar indices were reflected in the foF2 series, but in different relative proportions at the three locations, probably due to the interference of local aerodynamical effects. Some other periodicities were common to solar indices and foF2, while some others were present in the solar indices but not in foF2, or vice versa

   83:  The 12-month running averages of the meridional wind velocities obtained at Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer, showed transitions during the night which were of different natures during sunspot cycle maximum and minimum. The meridional component at 18-21 AST (Atlantic Standard Time) shifted form large southward at sunspot maximum to small northward at sunspot minimum. The meridional and zonal components at other local times showed small variations. The F-layer height obtained from incoherent scatter radar measurements decreased from about 400 km to about 300 km from sunspot maximum to sunspot minimum in a manner compatible with the variations of neutral wind

   83:  United States cloudiness data for 1950-1992 show quasi-biennial (QBO) and quasi-triennial (QTO) oscillations which match partly with the QBO and QTO of the Southern Oscillation (SO) index (the Tahiti minus Darwin pressure), but not with the QBO of the 50-mb equatorial zonal wind. Cloudiness also shows significant periodicities near 4.2 and 7.5 years, and probably a sunspot cycle effect (periodicities 11-14 years), with minimum cloudiness at or soon after sunspot minima, though this could be due to periodicities of 10 and 17 years observed in the SO index. During 1955-1970, cloudiness increased by about 1
   83:  . Thereafter, it remained almost steady for the eastern and central parts of the USA, but continued to rise until about 1980 for the western USA

   83:  Stratospheric temperatures show distinct trends, not necessarily monotonically upward or downward. At the North Pole, trends were large only during winter and spring and were different for different months; downward for November, December, mixed for January and upward for February, March and April. For the 10 degrees-90 degrees N belt, the trends were variable, viz., downward during 1971-1975, upward during 1975-1978 and downward again from 1978 onwards up to date, opposite to the upward trend of ground temperature in the Northern hemisphere in recent years. Twelve-monthly running averages revealed strnog QBO (quasi-biennial oscillation). For the North Pole, the QBO showed colder (lower) temperatures during 50-mb wind QBO westerly phase maxima. For the 10 degrees-90 degrees N belt, the QBO was similar for 30 mb and 50 mb but the QBO phases did not match well with 50-mb wind QBO phases

   83:  When seasonal variations were eliminated by evaluating 12-month running means, the ionospheric parameters foE, foF2 and hmF2 at Juliusruh (54.6 degrees N, 13.4 degrees E) showed large solar cycle variations. However, when further 3-yr running averages were evaluated and subtracted, QBO (Quasi-biennial oscillations) were noticed in all these parameters. Sunspot series did not reveal a QBO, but geomagnetic AP did show a QBO. The peaks of the ionospheric QBO and QBO of Ap could be roughly compared, with lags or leads of a few months. Also, these compared roughly with the well-known QBO peaks of tropical stratospheric (50 mb) zonal winds. Similar analyses at other locations are warranted

   83:  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a unique probe of cosmological parameters and conditions. There is a connection between anisotropy in the CMB and the topology of the universe. Adopting a universe with the topology of a three-torus, or a universe where only harmonics of the fundamental mode are allowed, and using 2 years of COBE/DMR data, we obtain constraints on the topology of the universe. Previous work constrained the topology using the slope information and the correlation function of the CMB. We obtain more accurate results by using all multipole moments, avoiding approximations by computing their full covariance matrix. We obtain the best fit for a cubic toroidal universe of scale 7200 h-1 Mpc for n=1. The data set a lower limit on the cell size of 4320 h-1 Mpc at 95
   83:   confidence and 5880 h-1 Mpc at 68
   83:   confidence. These results show that the most probable cell size would be ~1.2 times larger than the horizon scale, implying that the three-torus topology is no longer an interesting cosmological model

   83:  VLF radio signals (12.9 kHz) transmitted from  Argentina (43 degrees 12' S, 65 degrees 24'W) were received in Atibaia, Brazil (23 degrees 11'S, 46 degrees 33'W) during the total solar eclipse of 30 June 1992. The surface path of the totality crossed the VLF propagation path in the sunrise transition period causing a phase delay of 6A ps and an amplitude change of 1.3 dB. The ionospheric response to the Sun's obscuration was compared with the phase delays reported for several solar eclipses that occurred from 1966 to 1979. The results are mainly discussed in terms of the length of VLF propagation path affected. Some similarities between a sudden phase anomaly and a reversed eclipse effect are also raised

   83:  Very low frequency signals (VLF) received in Atibaia (Brazil) during the occurrence of the two major solar-proton events of August 1972 and July 1974 were analysed. Phase and amplitude changes observed at night were introduced in the model given by Wait and Spies (1964) properly adapted to the ionospheric conditions of the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly (SAGA) region. Electron density disturbed profiles for "L" shell intervals 1. 15 < L < 2.0 and 1.08 < L < 1. 15 were deduced. The results highlight the great amount of ionization produced at low "L" values due to the precipitation of energetic particles in the SAGA, mainly at night. Some discrepancies among the electron density profiles proposed by different authors are discussed

   83:  We report the results of a set of simulations that were designed to study the physical properties of the "fundamental plane" (FP) of elliptical galaxies. By starting with two similar king models and varying the orbital energy and angular momentum, we have investigated the global properties of the remnants. The characteristic parameters of the end products seem to follow closely the observed FP. This trend was confirmed by a subsequent set of simulations in which merger remnants were merged among themselves; that is, merging of objects in the FP produces a new object in the FP. We find that the small departure from the virial theorem, which is characteristic of the fundamental plane correlations, is explained by the nonhomologous nature of the remnants. The simulated FP has a very small intrinsic scatter: compared to the observed one it enables us to establish that the central potential Wo and the mass of the primordial units from which galaxies were formed could not have very broad distributions, although this is not a unique way to explain the difference in scatter between the predicted and the observed fundamental planes. Even though merging is selective (not all cosmological reasonable orbits merge), it cannot completely erase initial conditions. In other words, given appropriately correlated primordial units, subsequent merging will maintain a fundamental plane. Therefore, under the "dissipationless" approximation here, the FP should be independent of redshift (except for the evolution of theiur stellar populations) even if substantial merging has occurred

   83:  Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis of the time series for the onset dates of the southwest monsoon over Kerala (India) revealed several periodicities significant at a 2sigma apriori level, some at a 3 Csigma apriori level. However, these contributed only 40-50
   83:   to the total variance, thus indicating 50-60
   83:   as purely random component. Also, many of the significant periodicities observed were in the QBO region (T= 2-3 years) which due to their variable periodicities and amplitudes, are almost equivalent to a random component. Hence, predictions were possible only with a sigma limit exceeding 5 days, which are probably not very useful for any planning purposes, agricultural or otherwise. No relationship was found between onset dates of established monsoon rainfall and 50 h Pa mean monthly equatorial zonal wind for the months of March, April, May or June. However, there is a possibility that a relationship may exist between westerly (easterly) winds in May and early (late) onset of the first monsoon (or pre-monsoon?) rainfall in Kerala, meagre or otherwise

   83:  La capacidad para predecir con exactitud las variaciones climaticas representa probablemente el elemento mas importante para planificar, de una manera inteligente, las actividades futuras de las sociedades modernas. Desgraciadamente, los actuales conocimientos cientificos solo han mostrado progresos a ciertas escalas, en especial a escalas cronologicas de estacionales (100 dias) a interanuales (1 000 dias), para las que se ha demostrado exactitud en la prediccion, particularmente respecto al fenomeno del ENOS(El Nino/Oscilacion del Sur). Este progreso cientifico es uno de los  mayores logros del programa PMIC/TOGA (Oceano Tropical y Atmosfera Mundial), un programa internacional de investigacion de diez anos de duracion, auspiciado por la OMM, el CIUC y la COI, que finaliza en diciembre de 1994 (OMM, 1985). Se espera que las actividades posteriores al TOGA, dentro del marco del nuevo programa CLIVAR, alcancen los objetivos posteriores del TOGA, en lo relativo a la modelizacion, la prediccion, los estudios de los procesos y un sistema de observacion apropiado

   83:  Rainwater samples in S. Paulo city were collected on an event basis from October 1983 to October 1985 covering two dry and two rainy periods. Bulk samples only were obtained. At the same site  and period, fine, coarse and inhalable particles were also collected. Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, NO-3, SO2-4 and NH+4 contents were determined in rainwater samples, while Na, Ca, K, Cl and S concentrations were measured in aerosol samples. Rainwater is slightly acid (mean pH=5.0), and contains high concentrations of Ca2+, NO-3, SO2-4 and NH+4.  Dry and wet fluxes and washout ratios were determined for some elements. Results obtained suggest that the  atmosphere composition in this city is strongly influenced by anthropogenic sources

   83:  Two different blocking indices are computed for the Southern Hemisphere for the period 1979-1985, one is based on sea level pressure and the other on upper tropospheric zonal wind. The Southern Hemisphere blocking climatology based on these two indices separately presents very similar results, mainly in identifying the region of maximum occurrence over eastern Australia and the western Pacific. The sea level pressure index shows strong orographic influences, while the 250hPa zonal wind index is not affected by orography but does exaggerate seasonal variations. It is apparent that blocking occurrence in the eastern Australia and neighbouring areas has a link with climatological atmospheric features

   83:  Detailed observations of turbulence just above and below the crown of the Amazon rain forest during the wet season are presented. The forest canopy is shown to remove high-frequency turbulent fluctuations while passing lower frequencies. Filter characteristics of turbulent transfer into the Amazon rain forest canopy are quantified. In spite of the ubiquitous presence of clouds and frequent rain during this season, the average horizontal wind speed spectrum and the relationship between the horizontal wind speed and its standard deviation are well described by dry convective boundary layer similarity hypotheses originally found to apply in flat terrain. Diurnal changes in the sign of the vertical velocity skewness observed above and inside the canopy are shown to be plausibly explained by considering the skewness budget. Simple empirical formulas that relate observed turbulent heat fluxes to horizontal wind speed and variance are presented. Changes in the amount of turbulent coupling between the forest and the boundary layer associated with deep convective clouds are presented in three case studies. Even small raining clouds are capable of evacuating the canopy of substances normally trapped by persistent static stability near the forest floor. Recovery from these events can take more than an hour, even during midday

   83:    The MAGIC model is applied to a catchent in Central Amazonia to illustrate the potential effects of forest clearing on stream water chemistry. The results show effects on two time scales. On the short time scale ( up to 5 years), increased calcium, magnesium and potassium supplies to the soil, due to felling, augment base cation levels in the soils and promote higher cancentration of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and hydrogen ions in the stream. Such concentrations are particularly marked when deforestation results in the production of elevated concentrations of nitrate in the soil and the stream waters. On the centennial timescale, much smaller changes occur as the soils revert to pre-felling levels: calcium, magnesium and potassium concentrations in the stream reduce while sodium and hydrogen ions increase with time. This change is counter-balanced by changes in the cation exchange store: the rates of supply of cation from the atmosphere are sufficiently low for replenishment in the soil to be lengthy. It is concluded that there are many possible scenarios for how stream water chemistry will evolve with deforestation. The need for further field studies to characterise this variability is stressed

A sequencia de padroes do primeiro modo claramente indica uma propagacao dos "loadings" para leste, de um passo em tempo para o seguinte. A principal caracteristica deste modo e um dipolo nos "loadigs", orientado na direcao leste-oeste, sobre o oceano Indico/Pacifico oeste que se assemelha a associada a oscilacao intrasazonal(periodo de 30 a 60 dias) de Madden e Julian. A serie temporal de amplitudes deste modo apresenta flutuacoes mais pronunciadas durante o verao e outono do hemisferio sul com periodos variando de 40 a 55 dias. Tais flutuacoes apresentam marcada variabilidade interanual, com amplitudes relativamente reduzidas durante anos de extremos na Oscilacao Sul. As amplitudes projetadas do primeiro modo fornecem informacoes quanto a evolucao e intensidade das oscilacoes intrasazonais. Os resultados deste estudo indicam que as amplitudes projetadas podem ser utilizadas como indice para monitorar estas oscilacoes e para inferir epocas favoraveis a conveccao em certas regioes tropicais

Os resultados obtidos foram interpretados em funcao da contribuicao natural e antropica. Os balancos para Sodio e Amonia mostraram que a entrada total ( deposicao seca +umida) e menor do que a saida total na agua do rio, sendo obtido assim um balanco positivo. O balanco ionico foi negativo para Sulfato e Cloreto, e a razao Cloreto/Sulfato e maior do que um. Uma experiencia de lixiviacao dos solos de Cubatao, em laboratorio, mostrou que Sulfato e Cloreto sao adsorvidos e/ou absorvidos por eles. Esta absorcao, seguida pela retencao no mangue, explica a baixa concentracao destes ions nas aguas do Rio Quilombo, embora a entrada ionica no vale do Quilombo atraves da atmosfera seja muito alta

   83:  A brief review of the classification of climate models based on degrees of freedom is given.The advantages of zonally averaged climate models (ZACM) are mentioned. Two ZACM are described, a simple quasi-geostrophic (QG) model and a more complete primitive equations (PE) global model. These are used to conduct numerical experiments regarding the climatic change due to sea surface temperatures (SST) anomalies and land surface alterations. The experiments regarding de SST anomalies cinsider the situations of El Nino and La Nina. The results show that in the  El Nino situatin the subtropical jet stream and the  Hadley circulation are intensified and surface temperature increased in the perturbed region. The opposite situatin occurs in the case of La Nina. In the experiment of surface  state modification the interaction between the geobotanic state and the climate is considered. Experiments are conducted regarding deforestation and desertification. The results show that the change in the evapotranspiration rather than the change in the surface albedo is the predominant effect in regulanting the changes in the surface temperature

   83:   Airborne measurements are currently used for computing turbulence fluxes of heat and momentum. The method generally used is the eddy correlation technique, which requires sophisticated equipments to calculate the absolute velocities of the air. We used the well-known inertial dissipation method to calculate the turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum from low-level airborne measurements. This only requires knowledge of inertial subrange characteristics of velocity and scalars. The method was validated by comparing dissipation fluxes with those computed by the eddy correlation method. The agreement between the two is very good, particularly for heat fluxes. Last, it is shown how the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate can be easily calculated, using a single measurement (the attack angle by example), and therefore how turbulent fluxes can be simply calculated from low level airbone measurements

A literatura especializada apresenta discussoes controversas referentes a valores de k variado desde 0,2 ate 0,8. Neste trabalho o valor de k e estimado a partir dos dados coletados em uma floresta virgem de Terra Firme na Amazonia, a qual e parte integrante da Reserva Florestal Duck (2 graus 57minS; 59 graus 57minW), localizada proximo a Manaus, Amazonas. Valores de k sao obidos usando-se dados de velocidade de friccao (u*) e velocidade do vento em perfil, para condicoes de quase-neutralidade, coletados simultaneamente. Como resultado tem-se k=0,38, com um desvio padrao de 0,17, valor para o qual convergem os publicados na literatura.

   83:   Medidas de radiacao solar global foram executadas dentro e fora de mata tropical umida de terra firme durante o dia 07 de novembro de 1986, em Tucurui, Para. As intensidades de radiacao solar incidentes em 3 sensores instalados aleatoriamente no chao da floresta e um sensor localizado em area aberta (sensor padrao) sao avaliadas e intercomparadas. A radiacao media que atinge o chao da floresta foi 4,7
   83:   da radiacao incidente em area aberta adjacente a floresta. As diferencas entre as medidas dos sensores da mata e o padrao podem ser atribuidas a distribuicao espacial heterogenea da radiacao solar que alcanca o chao da floresta

   83:   A simple and easily implemented method is developed to keep the vertical velocity equal to zero at the bottom and top of hydrostatic incompressible numerical models. The pressure is computed at the top by correcting its value given in the previous time step so that the vertical integral of the horizontal divergence is zero at each column. Numerical experiments that exhibit small time variations of pressure at the top are able to simplify the algorithm and save computer time. Numerical simulations illustrate the method effectiveness for a horizontal deformation-induced frontogenesis

   83:  Correlation coefficients between the meridional wind and zonal wind and temperature can be used to define the efficiency of eddy transport of momentum and heat. We used such a definition and found that medium-scale baroclinic eddies become efficient in transporting heat and momentum during the mature stage of the life cycle.The correlation coefficients between eddy momentum efficiency and eddy heat transports and heat efficiency are significantly high showing that efficiencies are associated with higher momentum and heat transport. We found that nongeostrophic components are more for the momentum transport than for the heat transport. We calculated the contribution of nongeostrophic components for different forms of the energies and also for the energy conversion. It is found that the highest contribution of nongeostrophic components is for eddy available potencial energy which is around 40
   83:   and the lowest is for conversion term between zonal and pertubation available potencial energies which is around 10

   83:   A global two-layer satistical-dynamical primitive equations model is developed to simulate the mean annual conditions and the annual cycle of some zonally averaged atmospheric variables. The model is also used to conduct climatic change experiments related to surface boundary conditions like the sea surface temperature anomalies. The results show that the mean annual conditions and the annual cycle of the zonally averaged atmosphere are reasonably well-simulated. The response of sea surface temperature anomalies for the cases of El Nino, La Nina  and the dipole mechanism involving the centers of positive and negative anomalies is studied, In the case of El Nino there is an incrase in the 500 mb temperature and the jet at 250 mb is intensified in both hemispheres. There is also an intendification of the Hadley cell and an increase of the precipitation in the tropical region. The opposite occurs in the case of La Nina. In the experiment considering the dipole case the rising motion in the Hadley cell increases in the northern hemisphere and decreases in the southern hemisphere, and the precipitation is enhanced in the tropical region of the northern hemisphere and reduced in the southern hemisphere

   83:    Using the data for the period 1914-83, rainy and dry seasons of eastern Northeast (ENE) Brazil are determined. The principal rainy season is April through July (60
   83:   of the annual rainfall), and the principal dry season is September through December (10
   83:   of the annual rainfall). The fall and winter rains over ENE Brazil are associated with southeasterly winds blowing perpendicular to the coast. The subtropical high in the South Atlantic modulates the strength and direction of winds along the coast that have a determining influence on the interannual variations of rainfall over ENE Brazil. The possible link between the rainfall over ENE Brazil and SST anomalies in the Atlantic is examined. The SST anomalies of the season January, February, March, April (JFMA) in the southeast Atlantic are positively correlated with the rainfall anomalies of ENE Brazil.The sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly pattern frequently becomes established by January/February over southeast Atlantic suggesting the predictive value of SST anomalies over southeast Atlantic for the rainfall over ENE Brazil

   83:  Neste trabalho foram realizados estudos relativos a dinamica da formacao e evolucao da Camada Limite Atmosferica (CLA) desenvolvidas sobre a regiao tropical e area desmatada, na area de Ji-Parana, no sudoeste da Amazonia. Estas analises foram realizadas com dados observacionais de radiosondagens, balao cativo e fluxos turbulentos de superficie coletados em dois sitios experimentais, durante a realizacao do Experimento da Camada Limite de Rondonia (RBLE) nas epocas secas de 1993 e 1994. A Camada Limite Noturna (CLN) desenvolvida sobre floresta(tipicamente com espessura de 350-380 m) e mais profunda do que sobre pastagem (230-250 m) devido a sua maior rugosidade e turbulencia mecanica. Com consequencia deste fato, a intensidade da inversao termica da superficie na pastagem (tipicamente de 45-50 K.km-1) e superior ao da floresta (25-30 K.km-1). Durante o dia, o crescimento da Camada Limite Convectiva(CLC) sobre a pastagem (da ordem de 2000-2200 m) e aproximadamente 1000 m maior do que sobre floresta, uma vez que o primeiro possui uma maior taxa de liberacao de calor sensivel para a atmosfera. O crescimento da CLN e CLC foi estudado usando modelos numericos uni-dimensionais. A modelagem uni-dimensional da CLN foi baseada em um modelo prognostico de desenvolvimento da inversao termica (Yamada, 1979). Os resultados obtidos ajustaram-se melhor aos pontos observacionais na area de pastagem do que sobre a floresta, embora subestimados: para os dados do RBLE 3 o modelo simulou uma altura final da CLN de 203 m para valor observacional de 230 m. Na floresta, a diferenca entre as alturas observada e calculada foi de 149m, provavelmente devido ao fato da estacionaridade do processo ocorrer na pastagem mais cedo do que na floresta. Resultados da sensibilidade do modelo mostraram que o resfriamento noturno da superficie e mais importante do que a divergencia do fluxo de energia para o crescimento da CLN. No caso da CLC, um sistema de equacoes prognosticas, baseada na teoria desenvolvida por Tennekes (1973) foi desenvolvimento, descrevendo a altura, a temperatura potencial virtual media da camada e a intensidade da descontinuidade termica no topo da CLC e simulado com os dados do RBLE 2 e RBLE 3. Os resultados mostraram que o modelo subestima os valores observacionais da altura da CLC e que esta diferenca e na pastagem do que na floresta. A temperatura potencial media estimada pelo modelo superestima os valores observacionais e esta diferenca e de aproximadamnete 0,5 K na floresta e 1,5 K na pastagem. A pouca habilidade do modelo em representar o crescimento da CLC, principalmente na pastagem, e devido a circulacao termica secundaria (brisa de floresta), originada pela disposicao de linhas de remanescentes de floresta tropical inseridas em areas de pastagem, alterando o balanco de energia da superficie e a erosao da CLN. Esta brisa foi simulada usando um modelo numerico bidimensional de mesoescala (The regional Atmospheric Modeling System- RAMS) e seu sinal observado, atraves da intensificacao do vento horizontal e de celulas convectivas. A estimativa da energia advectada nesta situacao no inicio da manha e de 0,07 K.m.s-1, a qual e da mesma ordem de magnetude dos fluxos turbulentos de superficie medidos

   83:  The anual cycle and rainfall anomalies of the Southern Brazil Region are studied. Also, the relationship between the anomalies with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon are examined using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. It was found that the ENSO plays an important role in the interanual rainfall variability in the region. During warm episodes (El Nino) the region is affected with positive anomalies (flooding) during almost all months of the year. The cold episodes (La Nina) are associated with droughts mostly during October-November and from June to August of the year following the episode. Although the ENSO has an evident role in the rainfall anomalies in the Southern Region, a significant fraction of these anomalies occurs independently of the phenomenon. Canonical Coorelation Analysis (CCA) is used to investigate the relationship between the tropical and southern portions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, through the sea surface temperature (SST), and the rainfall anomalies in the Southern Region. It was found that during December-February period both oceans are important to determine the rainfall variability; during March-May and June-August seasons the Pacific Ocean conditions seem to be most determinant. On the other hand, during September-November season the conditions prevailing in the Atlantic SST seem to be crucial to explain the rainfall variability in the Southern Brazil Region

   83:  A caracterizacao dos processo devidos a forcamentos climaticos sobre variaveis ambientais e socio-economica em escala interanuais tem sido dificultada pela falta de uma ferramenta eficiente de estimacao de correlacao atrasadascruzadas entre series autocorrelacionais e ruidosas. Apesar do grande desenvolviemto atingido na analise de series espaco-temporais geofisicas atraves do uso de metodo canonicos, principalmente nos campos de meteorologia oceanografia, poucos resultados tem sido obtidos na caracterizacao das estruturas temporais de segundo momento que envolvem as interacoes oceano-atmosfera-biosfera. A presente tese visa contribuir para a diminuicao desta lacuna. Uma rapida visao do estado da arte, com aplicacao a exemplos especificos, pretende demonstrar as dificuldades mais importantes de estimacao nao resolvidos pelos metodos classicos autorregressivos e metodos de estimacao espectrais mais modernos como os chamados POP e PIP. Metodos canonicos da decomposicao Singular para o calculo de correlacao canonicas atrasadas e introduzida demonstrando-se este metodo resolve o problema da existencia de interacao e da representacao digital otima dos sinais

   83:  Neste trabalho desenvolveu-se um modelo de previsao de ondas de superficie do mar geradas pelo vento. O espectro e obtido atraves de uma equacao de balanco de energia onde os termos envolvidos sao adveccao, refracao, geracao e dissipacao de energia, shoaling e interacoes nao-lineares. Este modelo pode ser considerado do tipo acoplado discreto pois tanto o espectro de vagas quanto ondulacoes sao representados discretamente nas frequencias e direcoes. E um modelo de segunda geracao, uma vez que o espectro de vagas e calculado de modo que reproduza, atraves de interacoes nao-lineares, o espectro de kruseman. Os termos de geracao e dissipacao de energia foram ajustados com as curvas de crescimento de vagas obtidas empiricamente por Sanders. No calculo do termo de adveccao de energia utilizou-se um esquema numerico semilagrangiano com interpolacao biquadratica. Em situacoes de mudancas bruscas da direcao do vento utilizou-se uma parametrizacao em que parte da energia nas direcoes referentes as vagas fica retida na forma de ondulacoes, fazendo com que, nos primeiros instantes apos a mudanca da direcao do vento, nao ocorra uma diferenca muito marcante entre os espectros direcionais de vagas e de ondulacoes. Foram realizados alguns experimentos numericos com campos de vento idealizados onde a contribuicao de cada termo envolvido e analisada. Foi realizado ainda um experimento com batimetria na regiao do litoral de Santa Catarina, Parana, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, e sul da Bahia para que os termos de refracao e shoaling pudessem ser analisados. Os casos simulados quando comparados com resultados teoricos e com os obtidos pelos modelos operacionais mostraram-se bastante satisfatorios.

   87:  TROCA DE ENERGIA
   83:  Desenvolveu-se um modelo global de equacoes primitivas em coordenada vertical sigma, espectral e nao-linear, para estudar a resposta atmosferica a fontes tropicais de calor. Enfatizou-se a analise energetica, tanto no que se refere as trocas verticais de energia como para as interferencias entre os modos horizontais de oscilacao (ondas de Rossby, Kelvin, mista e gravidade). Na solucao da estrutura vertical da atmosfera utilizou-se a expansao em modos verticais normais obtendo um problema de autovalor-autovetor onde os autovalores sao identificados como profundidade equivalente e os autovetores compoem a estrutura vertical associada com cada modo vertical normal. Para a solucao da estrutura horizontal se fez uso das Funcoes Vetoriais de Hough como base para expansao das variaveis. O problema de autovalor-autovetor resultante tem como solucao a frequencia de oscilacao de cada modo horizontal (autovalor) e os autovetores sao os coeficientes de expansao das funcoes de Hough. As equacoes que compoem a estrutura horizontal da atmosfera foram escritas em forma espectral, com truncamento romboidal (R31), e os coeficientes de expansao para as forcantes e termos nao-lineares foram obtidos atraves do metodo da transformada numerica. A integracao no tempo utilizou o esquema semi-analitico. As fontes de calor foram dimensionadas com forma e posicao comparaveis a conveccao tropical e representadas por um campo tridimensional, com dependencia temporal do tipo transiente ou estacionaria. Mostrou-se que a particao de energia esta associada com a forma geometrica e a posicao latitudinal da forcante. Fontes de calor localizadas mais proximas do Equador e alongadas zonalmente excitaram muito mais a geracao de modos gravitacionais do que as fontes mais circulares e relativamente mais distantes da faixa equatorial. Concluiu-se que a resposta atmosferica em latitudes medias foi mais intensa para a simulacao realizada com um campo inicial diferente de zero, e mais intensa no Hemisferio Norte. A analise energetica dos experimentos mostrou que ocorreram trocas de energia entre os modos verticais normais para o experimento com condicao inicial observada, associadas ao cilhamento vertical do escoamento zonal medio. A porcentagem de energia total relativa aos produtos cruzados (PX) permitiu avaliar as interferencias entre as ondas. Concluiu-se que a atuacao dos produtos cruzados foi dominante na faixa intertropical (entre 35 graus N e 30 graus S)

   83:  A finalidade deste estudo e identificar e determinar as caracteristicas dos sistemas meteorologicos que produzem chuvas intensas no Vale do Itajai (SC), as quais eventualmente provocam enchentes. E realizado um estudo de 21 casos, selecionados a partir da precipitacao diaria registrada na bacia do rio Itajai. Sao utilizadas cartas de superficie, imagens de satelite e dados de altitude em pontos de grade. Cada um dos casos e dividido em fase inicial e madura de acordo com o desenvolvimento do sistema sinotico. Com estes dados e outros parametros derivados, sao identificados os sistemas sinoticos na baixa e alta troposfera. Esses sistemas sao agrupados de acordo com configuracoes comuns, resultando em cinco grupos com situacoes diferentes que podem produzir chuvas intensas. O grupo 1, apresenta um sistema frontal estacionario sobre a Regiao Sul, as vezes ondulando no oeste de Santa Catarina. A permanencia deste sistema frontal sobre a Regiao Sul esta associada a presenca de um vortice ciclonico nos altos niveis da Regiao Nordeste que parece bloquear o seu deslocamento. No grupo 2, um vortice ciclonico nos altos niveis cruza os Andes e aproxima-se da Regiao Sul, gerando as chuvas, principalmente a noite. No grupo 3 observou-se uma corrente de jato com curvatura anticiclonica passando sobre o Rio Grande do Sul. Esta corrente de jato induz movimentos verticais nas regioes de entrada e saida do centro de velocidades maximas nos altos niveis, onde sao criadas circulacoes transversais que favorecem o desenvolvimento convectivo. No grupo 4, ocorre intensa difluencia no escoamento zonal dos altos niveis durante a fase madura de desenvolvimento dos episodios. No grupo 5, um sistema frontal passa pela Regiao Sul e retrocede como frente quente, estacionando sobre Santa Catarina e Parana. Conforme a frente quente aproxima-se, a conveccao e intensificada podendo haver frontogenese. Nos baixos niveis, para a maioria dos episodios, a presenca de um fluxo de ar umido que se origina no Brasil Central, e a fonte alimentadora da conveccao que e disparada quando mecanismos dinamicos, tais como sistemas frontais e vortices ciclonicos aproximam-se da Regiao Sul do Brasil

Bobronnikov, do Moscow Aviation Intitute-MAI, ministraram a disciplina ANS 412-4 "Guiagem e Controle". Tive a oportunidade de atender a esse curso, entao. O problema resolvido a seguir foi-nos apresentado durante as aulas. A formulacao para o problema da correcao orbital do satelite, isto e, obtencao do estado final desejado em termos de posicao e velocidade, principalmente quanto ao modelo proposto, representou para mim novidade. A pesquisa bibliografica infrutifera de solucoes para o problema com tal formulacao comprovou isso. Como o problema foi resolvido, surgiu a ideia de documentar a experiencia adquirida

This matrix form is derived and applied to time integration of a barotropic limited area model, the DYNAMO model. We start from a matrix formulation for DYNAMO model, which is described as a non-linear matrix differential equation. It can be solved by an analycal non-modal, matrix solution. The Helmholtz wind field reconstruction is made by using the singular value decomposition in conection with Moore-Penrose generalized inverse

   83:  Os sensores de horizontes (SH) sao mecanismos do subsistema de controle de atitude (SCA) de satelites artificiais terrestres utilizados na determinacao da orientacao do satelite com relacao a Terra. O desempenho dos sensores de horizonte e limitado por erros sistematicos e aleatorios, montando  0.5 graus. Neste trabalho procede-se a modelagem matematica e simulacao computacional de algumas das principais fontes de erros sistematicos. A saber : 1) achatamento da Terra; 2) variacao sazonal e latitudinal da  radiancia terrestre; 3) atraso introduzido pelo processamneto eletronico. Os erros sao quantificados e montam  0.26 graus em arfagem e rolamento tornando passiveis de correcao. De posse de tais erros modelados e feitas as correcoes cabiveis e possivel melhorar a precisao na determinacao da atitude reduzindo o erro em arfagem para 0.015 graus e o erro em rolamento para 0.02 graus, o que representa melhora significativa na precisao total de apontamento. Ainda neste trabalho e demonstrada a importancia do uso de tecnicas normalizadoras de radiancia na melhora da precisao na determinacao da atitude de sensores de horizonte na faixa infra-vermelha correspondente ao CO2

   83:   A multilevel limited-area primitive equations model in eta coordinate is used to simulate the effects of the Amazonian latent heat source and the Andean topography on the summer (December, January, February) circulation over the South American region. The observed circulation features, such as the Bolivian high and the trough near the coast of Northeast Brazil in the upper troposphere, the elongated South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) oriented northwest to southeast from the southern Amazon region into the Atlantic Ocean, and the subtropical anticyclones in the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans in the lower levels are well simulated. Although heating alone produces the SACZ,the moutain and the basic flow put in the observed position. It is found that regular daily pulses of heating are necessary for the maintenance of the SACZ. The position and intensity of the SACZ change rather substantially from the no-mountain case, thus showing the importance of the effect of the Andes on determining the convergence zone

   83:   A long-term model of stream acidification, MAGIC, has been applied to an acidic moorland catchment, the Gwy, in mid-Wales. This application has been used to examine the effects of variability of weathering on soil, groundwater and stream water chemistry from 1844 to the present day and onwards to 2080 with a predicted acidic oxide reduction of 60
   83:   in the future. The results show that weathering initially affects soil, groundwater and stream water chemistry profoundly. Despite this, the results indicate that a simple two-layer ( one soil and one groundwater end-member) model can still provide a good prediction of long-term stream water quality even when each soil and groundwater area is heterogeneous in composition. The work provides support for the use of the lumped MAGIC model. However, for the predictions to be applicable it is shown that it is critical that the relative contribution of waters and soil exchange materials from the hydrochemically distinct region with in the catchment are adequately represented within the model. This probably means that further field work is required to examine source contributions

Durante a primenira quinzena as chuvas foram escassas e apenas as do sul do Ceara estiveram marginalmente relacionadas com a posicao anomala da ZCAS. Durante o restante do mes houve excessivas precipitacoes na maior parte do Estado que estiveram relacionadas com a ZCAS anomalamente ao norte e com a ZCIT anomalamente ao sul. E aparente que a ZCAS durante este periodo atuou como um fator secundario, abaixando a pressao de superficie nas latitudes equatoriais, o que favoreceu o deslocamento da ZCIT para o sul, enquanto a ZCIT comportou-se como o principal mecanismo para organizar a convencao durante a segunda quinzena de dezembro de 1989 no Ceara

Existem algumas indicaoes, baseadas nas medias a cada cinco dias da Pressao ao Nivel do Mar (PNM) e da Radiacao de Onda Longa (ROL), que mostram que a conveccao tropical possivelmente foi fortemente modulada pela oscilacao intra-sazonal durante o presente verao do Hemisferio Sul

   83:   Nos estudos de aproveitamento hidreletrico de bacias, uma pratica comum e fazer transposicao das precipitacoes pluviomentricas de uma bacia que possua series longas de dados para a bacia em estudo. Isso e muito comum na Amazonia, dada a escassez de dados na regiao. Este trabalho mostra, araves das analises dos totais pluviometricos em diferentes estacoes do ano, que nao e recomendavel utilizar series pluviomentricas coletadas as margens dos grandes rios para gerar series sinteticas no interior da bacia. Um mecanismo de circulacao de ar local conhecido como brisa fluvial pode estar reduzindo os totais pluviometricos das estacoes a beira do rio.Como a maior parte das estacoes da Amazonia foram preferencialmente colocadas as margens dos rios devido a facilidade de acesso, e provavel que o verdadeiro total pluviometrico da grande bacia esteja sendo subestimado, em outras palavras, chove mais do que se supoe

As series de precipitacao cobrem o periodo de 35 anos (1951-1985). Efetuou-se ACPR para as series originais e, tambem, para series onde removeu-se o ciclo anual de modo a procurar-se os padroes de variabilidade inteanual dos campos de precipitacao. Os quatro primeiros Componentes Principais (CPs) explicam 65,1 (32,6) da variancia para os casos com o ciclo (sem o ciclo) anual. Os dois primeiros padroes no caso com o ciclo anual relacionam-se fortemente a aspectos do ciclo sazonal de precipitacao na Amazonia: o dipolo norte-sul de maximas precipitacoes no hemisferio de verao para o primeiro padrao, e a migracao sazonal da ACIT (e linhas de instabilidade associdas na costa atlantica amazonica para o segundo padrao. A forma do primeiro padrao no sul da Amazonia segere uma associacao deste com o ciclo sazonal da Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul (ZCAS). O segundo e quarto padroes do caso o sem ciclo annual parecem estar relacionados a eventos El Nino-Oscilacao Sul. Verificou-se esta associacao atraves da analise espectral cruzada entre o Indice de Oscilacao Sul e os coeficientes das series temporais (Scores) associados a estes padroes

Tendencias lineares de aquecimento de 0,007 a 0,012C por ano foram observadas em Belem, Fortaleza, Salvador e Curitiba. Valores bem superiores ocorrem em Sao Paulo (0,03) e Rio de Janeiro (0,02). Nao existem tendencias nas series de Manaus, Cuiaba e Porto Alegre, sugerindo que os valores observados nas outras localidades sejam devidos a urbanizacao e nao ao aquecimento global que poderia ser provocado pelo efeito estufa

   83:   Uma frente fria, acompanhada de uma crista da mesoscala na alta troposfera(250 mb), deslocando-se rapidamente para nordeste, foi a responsavel pelas chuvas fortes que aconteceram nos dias 18 e 19 de abril de 1990, no Rio de Janeiro e redondezas. A localizacao favoravel dos anticiclones propiciou uma confluencia na regiao da frente na baixa troposfera

As massas de ar frio, com pressoes centrais da ordem de 1030 mb, levaram cerca de 72 horas para se deslocar do continente ate o litoral da Regiao Sudeste do Brasil. O padrao do fluxo na alta troposfera apresentou forte confluencia das correntes de Sul e de oeste sobre o Paraguai, precedendo a friagem e ocorrencia de geadas nestas regioes. Verificou-se que o prognosticos do National Meteorological Center(NMC), com ate 72 horas de antecedencia, apontaram o acontecimento de friagem na Regiao Sul e adjacencias

Values of surface conductance were derived and compare well expected trends

   83:   acima da media. O episodio El Nino de aquecimento das aguas do Pacifico Equatorial, atualmente em sua fase madura com intensidade moderada, enfrequeceu em fevereiro. No entanto, espera-se que este episodio ainda causara diminuicao das chuvas sazonais no norte do Nordeste e leste da Amazonia em 1992. Os parametros oceanicos e atmosfericos do Atlantico Tropical modificaram-se neste mes assumindo caracteristicas desfavoraveis as chuvas no Nordeste. Levando-se em consideracao todos os fenomenos atuantes no momento que influenciam o clima do norte do Nordeste e a precipitacao ocorrida no mes de fevereiro, reforcado ainda pela ocorrencia de um episodio quente do fenomeno El Nino-Oscilacao Sul de intensidade moderada, estima-se que o total das chuvas da quadra chuvosa (fevereiro a maio) para a regiao norte do Nordeste como um todo deve permanecer abaixo da media climatologica (15 a 30
   83:   abaixo da media), com uma distribuicao temporal irregular, com periodo de chuvas intercalados por periodo de veranicos. Provalvemente, os maiores impactos do episodio El Nino-Oscilacao Sul em curso sobre as chuvas do semi-arido dar-se-ao na segunda metde da quadra chuvosa (abril e maio), isto e, uma diminuicao das chuvas deste periodo mais acentuada

Foram observadas chuvas generalizadas pelo semi-arido apenas ate os primeiros 10 dias de abril quando entao a ZCIT se deslocou mais para o norte e as chuvas passaram a ser localizadas, preferencialmente ao longo do litoral.

A disponibilidade hidrica dos acudes da regiao esta reduzida e uma grande quantidade de acudes de pequeno (e ate mesmo de medioporte) ja secou. A situacao nao apresentou nenhuma melhora nas duas primeiras semanas de janeiro deste ano, caracterizadas pela total ausencia de chuvas no norte da regiao semi-arida, o que as precipitacoes deste mes quase certamente ficarao aquem dos valores normais

   83:  The objective of this paper is to study the problem of gravitational capture in the regularized restricted three-body problem. A gravitational capture occurs when a massless particle changes its two-body energy around one celestial body from positive to negative without the use of non-gravitational forces. We studied the importance of several of the parameters involved for a capture in the Earth-Moon system, including the time required for the capture and the effects of the periapse distance. Then, we generalize those results for other binary systems, like the Sun-Earth, Sun-Mars and Sun-Jupiter systems. Next, we cover the whole interval of the mass parameter  (the mass ratio of the two primaries) and we study the gravitational capture in the interval 0.0 <  < 0.5. The elliptical restricted problem is also considered as an option for the model

   83:  Measurements from the first comparative study of climate over Amazonian tropical forest and an embedded deforested clearing are presented. Observations comprise a continuous 60-day run of data from mid-October to mi-December 1990, covering the end of the dry season and beginning of the wet season. Mean hourly observations are calculated for the hole period; and for two 10-day periods, one in the dry season and one at the start of the wet season. Much greater variation in weather variables was observed at the clearing compared with over the forest. While the mean values of temperature and specific humidity deficit differed by less than 1  C and 1 g kg-1 respectively, their daily ranges at the clearing were twice those at the forest. Mean daily albedo of the forest was 1.1 per cent, agreeing well with other tropical forest measurements, and of the clearing was 16.3 per cent, somewhat  lower than the values currently being used in GCMs. The surface energy balance was investigated and mean available energy calculated for each site. The significant difference  in the daily pattern of net radiation between the sites was found to be least as much due differences in the langwave radiation balance as to differences in albedo. the diurnal pattern of net radiation therefore changed between dry and wet period as the higher plant water stress experinced by clearing vegetation alterd the daily temperature cycle

   83:  The influence of middle cyclones and their associated clod fronts on open-ocean fronts is studied with an embedded mixed layer ocean circulation model similar to that of Adamec et al. (1981). Finite differences with horizontal resolution of 5 km in a staggered grid are used to solve the model equations within a domain of tatal meridional extension of 300 km and 500 m depth. three numrical experiments were performed to investigate the response of an oceanic front, similar to the South Atlantic subtropical convergence zone, to an atmospheric frontal passage. Under the effect of the cold air outbreak the thermal and dynamic structures of the upper layer are substantially modifield with a higher singking/cooling rate of the mixed layer. The sinking/cooling rate depends strongly on the magnitude of the thermal gradient at the top of the thermocline and on the mixed layer depth. Due to the differences in sinking/cooling rates, a single storm can move the oceanic front up to 20 km from its initial the position. For low-intensity winds, a change in the wind direction does not affect the thermal structure of the upper layer ocean, even inthe frontal region. The mixed layer oscillations are entirely a function of the daily scale of the solar heating. For a sudden change in the wind direction, the response of the current velocity field in the mixed layer is almost instantaneous

   83:  The aim of this work was to test the accuracy of simulated sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Atlantic Ocean for the period 1982 to 1990 using a three-dimensional primitive-equation oceanic general circulation model. The SST reference was provided by monthly analysis of observed data obtained from selected ships. The annual mean difference between simulated and observed SST did not exceed 1.5    C, but monthly mean differences of several degrees found for some areas. There were two main problem areas, one along the western zone and other within the northern part the Gulf of Guinea. The first, characterized by excessively cold SST, corresponded to a westward early shifting of seasonal equatorial surface cooling; and the second, characterized by excessively warm SST, concerned a region of the Gulf of Guinea where winds were ight at sea warm. A series of  test experiments was performed during one year (1989) using  diret measurements of the meteorological varables with enter into the computation of turbulent heat flux forcing, with all other conditions remaining unchanged. the generally disappointing results may relate to the heat flux sensitiviy induced by weakvariations among basic meteorological variables

Photosynthic gains of carbon dioxide exceeded respirar iosses irrespective of the season. These gains cannot be attributed to measurements en nor to ioss of carbon dioxide by drainage of cold air nigth. A process-baed model, the to the data, enabled estimation of the carbon absorbed by the ecosystem over the  as 8.5+-2.0 moles per square meter per year

The SL days had in common a stronger and deeper low-level jet when compared with the days without SL. two possible explanation are found for the intensification of the low-level jet: propagation easterly waves inthe tropical Atlantic, which eventually reach Manaus, and localized heat sources in the western Amazon. Both were observed on 5-6 May. It is suggested that numerical should be performed to unravel the relative importance of each large-scale mechanism

   83:   A comparison is made between the methods for solving the stochastic collection equation fo Berry and Teinhardt, using 72 categories, and the method of moments as improved by Tzivion et al., using only 36 classes. The computations, carried out for different kernels and several initial mean drop radii, showed that the mumerical acceleration inherent to the Bleck's method is also present in the approach of Tzivion et al., but in a weaker form. This accleration depends on the type of kernel and, for cloud conditions allowing coalescence development, it remains between acceptable limits and decreases with time. When the method of moments is rum for 72 categories, the numerical acceleration pratically disappears. Although, in terms of mass storage, the requirements of both methods are the same, in terms of computational speed, this approach has advantages over Berry and Reinhardt's method for use in cloud models with detailed description of microphysical processes

Analyses suggest that the values of  (i.e., the ratio of eddy diffusivitty coefficients of heat K  and water vapor K ) vary from -2.67 to 2.70 in the Richardson number range -0.17 to 0.28 and the negative sign of   arises in the cases of countergradient heat flux.

   83:  Micrometeorological data sets collected over the Amazon forest at the Ducke Reserve site (2 degres 57'S; 59 degrees 57' W) gave an opportunity to estimat evaporative heat flux QE . The estimated values of daytime hourly QE   from the modified Priestley-Taylor method are compared with direct measurements. The comparison indicates that the proposed empirical method gives reasonably good results for a variety of problems. Evidence presented here and by others shows that there is a pronounced diurnal variation in Priestley-Taylor parameter  . Analysis of this data set leads to the preliminary conclusion that   has a seasonal variation, because there is a linear variation between Q  and the equilibrium latent heat flux Q   with nonzero intercept   =20 W m   from a regression analysis between Q  and  Q  . These calculated values of  ' and   in general agreement with those reported in literature

   83:  At this work is introduced a parameterization of radiative process in a simple climatic model, wich consider the mean zonal atmosphere. This model is hemispheric, quasi-geostrophic, and had a simple radiation parameterization. The new parameterization introduced in the model is more sofisticated than the old one and is more versatile relative to perform of sensitivity experiments. In the parameterization of solar radiation the characteristics of atmosphere, like reflexivity, absorvitivity and transmitivity depend of contribution related to the atmosphere without clouds and covered. In the parameterization of long wave radiation, is considered the effect of gas with greather absorption: CO2 and water vapour. The resulted show that the radiative fluxes are generally better simulated in regard to before parameterization and that the zonal averaged characteristics of atmosphere are correctaly simulated by the model

   83:  Vulcanic eruptions of large scale has been studied due to a strong correlation with climate. Eruptions when inject large amount of sulphuric acid, in the estratosphere, carry to changes in the net flux of radiation and surface temperature. Recent observations data of eruptions explain that the larger part of cases hapenned in regions near to equador (until 20 degres of latitude, in both hemispheres). Establishing at that's informations, the objective of this study is to force a simple climatic model with a planetary albedo anomaly, like a vulcanic eruption, in the region near to equador, and to check the consedquent changes in the climate conditions. With a imposition of planetary albedo anomaly of 5 (five) percent in the two latitude belts nearest to equador genereted a cooling of surface, decrease of precipitation, and weakening of Hadley's cell and the subtropical jact

   83:  Clouds are one os the most influential and complicated factors that affect the comportment of atmospheric conditions. They have the property of reflect the solar radiation and also absorv and emit long wave radiations, contributing to green house effect. Thats properties change to different kind of clouds, its form, size and constituent components. At this work we attempt to investigate using a simple climatic model, what is the most dominant effect, the reflection of solar radiation or rellated property with green house effect. We pretend too undestend whats the consequence in the comportment of surface temperature caused by alteration of top level and basis of clouds. Is utilized a zonal averaged model, with the inclusion of parameterization of radiative process, where, to the solar radiation, the atmospheric characteristics (reflectivity, absorvitivity, and transmitivity) depend of contribution related to a clear sky and with clouds. To long wave radiation are considered the role of absorver gases CO2 and water vapour to atmosphere with and without clouds. The resulted explain that to increase the fraction of cloud cover, the albedo of clouds ha a dominant influence in tropical regions and mean latitudes. In polar regions the green house effect is dominant and surface temperature increases (decrease) when the cloud layer is higher (shorter)

   83:  Antropogenic ativities like fossil fluids burn and forest burn, had caused a significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Valuations denote that the actual concentration (350 ppmv) may be doubled betwen the years 2025 e 2050. CO2 had high transmissivity to solar radiation and high absorvity to long wave radiation (emited by earth-atmosphere system). So, a amplification in its concentration might enhance the green-house effect. The objective of this achievement is simulate with a simple climatic model the effects caused by the doubled of CO2 concentration. The used model is a global primitive equations model and consider zonally mean atmosphere. At this model is included a radiative process parameterization that consider the role of absorver gases of long wave radiation, CO2 and water vapour. The resulted explain that to double the CO2 concentration, happens a intensification of green-house effect evidenced by a smaler damage of long wave radiation emitted by the earth atmosphere and consequent increase of mean temperature of planet

   83:  The Rondonia Boundary Layer Experiment has been planned to study the interaction between the two most common vegetation covers in the Amazonia (forest an pasture) and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Up to now, 2 field campaig have been carried out to study the termodinamic struture of ABL, using rawinsoundings and tethered ballons. During the first intensive field campaign (IFC-1, september 1992) data collection took place only for the forest site (IBAMA's Jaru Biological Reserve, 10 01'S, 61 05'W, 120m). During IFC-2 (Jully 1993), measurements have been taken both at the forest and pasture (10 07'S, 62 03'W, 220m) sites, but for logical reasons, not simultaneoosly. For pasture, surface sensible heat is higher and evaporation is smaller compared to those fluxes at the forest site. The analysis of RBLE/IFC-2 data show that daytime ABL is well mixed and its heigth is higher over pasture than forest and that the height difference can be as high as 1 Km

   83:  Data analysis and numerical simulations of the atmospheric and oceanic PBL structure over the Atlantic Ocean area located in the upwelling region of Cabo Frio Coast, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (23grausS, 42graus08'W) is shown in this paper. During July 7-9, 1992, the wind varied from the NE to SW and the depth and temperature of the oceanic mixed layer increased respectively 1 2 graus C and 45m. The height of the of the PBL varied from 1 500m when the wind were from NE to 500m when the wind was from SW. The wind variation was associated with a cold front that arrived in the area in the evening of July 7. The role of the wind as driven mechanism for observed modifications in the oceanic PBL, is investigated by using a second order closure model for the atmosphere and a mixed layer model for the ocean. The numerical simulation was able to show the observed variation in the atmosphere but failed in to produce the observed deepening and the heating of the oceanic mixed layer. Therefore, reasonable explanation for these modifications is the weakening of the upwelling due to the change in the wind direction

   83:  The spatial variability of turbulent fluxes in the Surface Boundary Layer (SBL) of the atmosphere is studied, estimated both through the Eddy Correlation Method (ECM) and the Dissipative-Inertial Method (DIM), from airborne measurements. A stastical analysis of the variability is made based on the assumption that the signal is horizontally homogeneous. To that aim calculus for diverse flux integration lengths are made. For each integration interval, these fluxes are sucessively estimated over different moving segments along the available sample length. The results obtained were: (a) the spatial variability is smaller when the flux is calculated through the DIM; (B) in the DIM the variability is bigger for the momentum's flux and smaller for the heat's flux. However, in the ECM the spatial variability of the fluxes is approximately the same. The error's spatial variability of the fluxes through the DIM is also studied. An effort to explain physically the results is made

Fourier signal decomposition in this study a WT is applied to analize wind temperature and specific humidity signals measured at a frequency of 8 Hz during Airbone Experiment "TOSCANE - T" (Travaux d'Oceanographie Spatiale Capteurs Actifs dans I'Atlantique Nord-EST) made along the coast of Bretagne, France, in march 1985. Surface boundary layer measurements are analized. Results show the essentially nonhomogeneous behaviour of the turbulent fields above the ocean, which seem to organize in extremely localized structures

   83:  Low-level airborne turbulent measurements are used to validate an already known method the dissipative-inertial method (DIM) for the estimation of fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and latent heat. For this the eddy correlation technique (ECT) is used as reference method. The errors in the estimative of the fluxes through the two methods were calculated. In the ECT, the unertainties in the estimation of the fluxes were calculated as a function of the integral scale. For the uncertainties in the determination of the fluxes through the DIM, a method based on the dissipation rate's uncertainties of the inertial domain's spectral energy was developed it is shown that the DIM can be applied to the airbone measurements. The best result obtained was the one relative to the latent heat's flux, where the agreement continued good for a large range of studied conditions. Clear differences are observed between the behaviour of "thermal" and "mechanic" turbulence

   83:  A review of researches on the relationship between the tropical ocean sea surface temperatures (SST) and rainfall anomalies in Northeast Brazil was introduced. In this work, two neural network models are implemented to reconstruct and predict the time series of the SST in two regions: the tropical Atlantic ocean (Wright index, from 1854 to 1985) and the tropical Pacific ocean (regions Nino1-2: 0 N-10 S, 270 E-280 E and Nino4: 5 N-5 S, 160 E-150 E, from 1950 to 1995). The selected neural networks include Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN). Both were implemented in the neural network stimulator SNNS. For the Wright index, the trained Backpropagation Neural Network successfully predicted the index of the following four months with the relative errors from 1.40 to 3.34
   83:  . For SST in Nino1-2 and Nino4 regions, the Time Delay Neural Network was used for reconstruction and prediction. Comparing with the next six month observations and predictions, all of them are located within the predicted error bars. These results show that neural network methods may be used, within certain limits, for prediction and evaluation of predictability of time series measured from phenomena influenced by complex climatic and geophysical processes, like SST

   83:  one of the important areas where in spite of extensive work very little is known is turbulence. The first attempt to understand it from a statistical point of view was attempted as early as 1960 by Kolmogorov. Stolovitzky and Sreenivasan[l] have shown that the Kolmogorov's first and second refined similarity hypothesis can be derived for general stochastic processes without any reference to fluid dynamics. They have shown that the probability distribution for a antipersistant fractional Brownian process with exponent 1/3 is similar in many ways tothe high Reynolds number turbulence in atmospheric boundary layers a few meters above the ground. Our interest is if this exponent is valid at all time and is independent of region where it is measured. To this end we have tried to estimate this quantity from the wind velocity along the three orthogonal directions above a grassland during the day and at night

   83:  Um dos aspectos que chama mais a atencao na curva de nivel do Rio Paraguai em Ladario, como funcao do tempo, e a persistencia observada entre 64-73 e 74-91 na manutencao de niveis baixos (-57 a 269 cm) e altos (132 a 657 cm), respectivamente. O estudo de mudancas de tendencia, para que se entenda como elas vem a ocorrer, e bastante oportuno, principalmente com vistas na previsao. Mas a grande dificuldade para executa-lo esta na deficiencia de dados de precipitacao nas areas que captam agua para alimentar o rio. Em 1985, o sul do Brasil foi afetado, durante a maior parte do ano, por uma seca de grandes proporcoes. Neste estudo, tentamos entender como este periodo de seca afetou o nivel do Rio Paraguai em Ladario. Seria muito interessante saber se um evento como este poderia causar, por exemplo, uma descida de nivel como a que ocorreu em 1963

A Transformada em Ondeletas (TO), cuja base matematica foi constituida recentemente (Meyer, 1991), parece oferecer uma alternativa vantajosa a AF nestas situacoes. Ela decompoe a informacao contida na serie temporal tanto em tempo quanto em escala (frequencia). Assim, pode ser concebida como uma especie de Transformada de Fourier evolutiva

   83:   Sao realizados dois estudos relacionados a fatores (um de causa natural e outro induzido pelo homem) que influenciam o clima na regiao da floresta Amazonica. Um estudo observacional foi realizado com a finalidade de investigar o papel dos eventos El Nino e La Nina na variacao da precipitacao na regiao, os quais sao de causas naturais. Um outro estudo envolve um fator induzido pelas atividades do homem (desmatamento em regioes de florestas tropicais) que e realizado atraves de um Modelo Estatistico Dinamico Media Zonal (MED) de equacoes primitivas, hemisferico (considera apenas o hemisferio sul), o qual inclui uma parametrizacao do ciclo diurno da radiacao solar. Os resultados para o estudo observacional mostraram que existe uma tendencia de ocorrer um deficit na precipitacao durante o evento El Nino e um excesso para o evento de La Nina na maioria das estacoes estudadas. Os resultados do estudos de modelagem mostraram que ao substituir a floresta por pastagem, em todos os meses do ano houve um decrescimo do balanco de radiacao na superficie (devido ao aumento do albedo da superficie e consequente reducao na radiacao solar absorvida pela pastagem), uma diminuicao na evapotranspiracao (causada pelas diminuicoes do saldo de radiacao na superficie e da disponibilidade de agua na superficie) e um decrescimo na precipitacao e no movimento ascendente da celula de Hadley. Notou-se, ainda, um aumento na temperatura da superficie, evidenciando que o efeito do resfriamento devido a diminuicao da evepotranspiracao supera o da reducao do albedo da superficie. Os resultados obtidos com este modelo simples concordam qualitativamente com os obtidos com Modelos de Circulacao Geral, mostrando que a utilidade deste tipo de modelo em estudo de mudancas climaticas, notadamente na determinacao das relacoes "causa-efeito"

   83:   Introduziu-se uma nova parametrizacao dos processos radiativos nos modelos de simulacao climaticos zonal quase-geostrofico e de equacoes primitivas. Esta nova parametrizacao considera fisicamente de forma mais realista os processos rediativos comparativamente com a antiga e e bastante versatil quanto a experimentos de sensibilidades climeticas. De uma maneira geral os fluxos radiativos foram melhor simulados com a nova parametrizacao. Foram feitos experimentos de sensibilidade quanto a alteracoes da concentracao de CO2, da constante solar, da fracao de cobertura e altura de nuvens, anomalias de TSM relacionadas aos fenomenos El Nino e La Nina e anomalias de albedo planetario devido a erupcoes vulcanicas. Os resultados apresentaram uma maior sensibilidade das regioes polares, principalmente do hemisferio sul, quanto a alteracoes da constante solar e da concentracao de CO2. No experimento de cobertura de nuvens, o efeito das albedo das nuvens se apresentou como fator dominante nas regioes de baixas latitudes, e o efeito estufa das nuvens dominante nas outras regioes. Camadas de nuvens mais altas levaram a um maior aquecimento da superficie. Estudos de anomalias relacionadas aos fenomenos El Nino e La Nina se apresentaram qualitativamente compativeis com as observacoes. O aumento de albedo planetario imposto na regiao proxima ao equador, que pode ocorrer devido a erupcoes vulcanicas, levou a um resfriamento da superficie, diminuicao da precipitacao, e enfraquecimento da celula de Hadley e do jato subtropical

   83:  Neste trabalho sao definidos parametros meteorologicos que possam vir a caracterizar a presenca da Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul (ZCAS) sobre o Brasil. Os efeitos da ZCAS sobre esta regiao tambem sao investigados. Durante os veroes (Hemisferio Sul) de 1980 a 1989 foram selecionados e analisados 28 episodios de ZCAS sobre a America do Sul. A analise visual de imagens de satelites geostacionarios mostrou a Conveccao Tropical organizada, em termos de faixa com orientacao NW/SE, associada a presenca de sistemas frontais oriundos do sul do continente sulamericano. Dados em altitude do ECMWF em conjunto com dados de precipitacao fornecidos pelo INMET foram analisados. As analises sugerem que um episodio de ZCAS deva ocorrer associado aos seguintes padroes meteorologicos: convergencia de umidade na baixa e media troposfera; faixa de movimento ascendente do ar com orientacao NW/SE; um cavado semi-estacionario sobre a costa leste da America do Sul em 500 hPa; intenso gradiente de   na media troposfera e tambem uma faixa de vorticidade relativa anticiclonica em altos niveis (200 hPa). Este trabalho sugere que a ocorrencia de chuvas persistentes sobre as regioes afetadas pela ZCAS e uma caracteristica marcante nos episodios estudados. Atraves da comparacao de dois casos extremos de ZCAS sugere-se que, durante um evento de El Nino, a ZCAS apresenta-se inibida ou tende a se formar fora de sua regiao preferencial de ocorrencia (aproximadamente ao norte de 25 graus S sobre a costa leste do continente sulamericano)

   83:  A realistic fully time-dependent computer model which simulates the dynamic behavior of the low-latitude ionosphere is presented. The time evolution and spatial distribution of the ionospheric particle densities and velocities are computed by numerically solving the time-dependent, coupled, nonlinear system of continuity and momentum equations for the ions O+, O2+, NO+, N2+ and N+, taking into account photoionization of the atmospheric species by the solar extreme ultraviolet radiation, chemical and ionic production and loss reactions, and plasma transport processes, including the ionospheric effects of thermospheric neutral winds, plasma diffusion and electromagnetic E x B plasma drifts. The Earth's magnetic field is represented by a tilted centered magnetic dipole. This set of coupled nonlinear equations is solved along a given magnetic field line in a frame of reference moving vertically, in the magnetic meridian plane, with the electromagnetic E x B plasma drift velocity. The spatial and time distribution of the thermospheric neutral wind velocities and the pattern of the electromagnetic drifts are taken as known quantities, given through specified analytical or empirical models. The model simulation results are presented in the form of computer-generated colour maps and reproduce the typical ionization distribution and time evolution normally observed in the low-latitude ionosphere, including details of the equatorial Appleton anomaly dynamics. The specific effects on the ionosphere due to changes in the thermospheric neutral winds and the electromagnetic plasma drifts can be investigated using different wind and drift models, including the important longitudinal effects associated with magnetic declination dependence and latitudinal separation between geographic and geomagnetic equators. This report includes a reference catalog of colour maps showing the typical behavior of the low-latitude ionosphere in the Brazilian longitudinal region, for different seasons and geophysical conditions under solar maximum activity

This paper presents the basic concepts of the thermal design for the First Brazilian Scientific Application Satellite (SACI-1), being designed by Brazilian Space Research Institute (INPE). A pasive thermal control technique is used and the thermal analysis is accomplished by the nodal method, using the PCTER thermal software developed at INPE by the thermal group. The results indicate that the temperature of all satellite equipments can be kept within the specified range for any operation mode and orbital condition using only pasive means. An experiment set up is being designed to evaluate the mathematical thermal model by an Engeneering Qualification Model (EQM) of the satellite

   83:  This paper describes the structural design and analysis of the Brazilian Scientific Applications Satellite (SACI-1) that is devised as a multipurpose bus for scientific applications. The structure includes a Mainbody (Platform and Payload), an Adapter, four deployable panels and the holddown and release mechanisms (HDR). Its overall shape resembles a parallelepiped measuring 600 x 400 x400 mm (Mainbody only) and weighting about 65 kg (Mainbody plus Adapter). The Platform consists on a pack of 9 aluminum ribbed frames of different thickness stacked horizontally and connected by means of 12 stud bolts. The Payload is assembled on the top of the Platform and has six ribbed plates that form a box in which most of the payload is assembled.The separation is accomplished by cutting (or releasing) one central rod that joins the Platform to the Adapter. The analysis of this structure was performed using a FEM model for static, normal modes, frequency response, transient response and random vibration analysis. With these results it was possible:(a) to verify the preliminary design of the structure and define the necessary changes; (b) to determine the first global frequencies of the assembly and; (c) to verify the accelerations on the printed circuit boards

   83:  The Gyrotron Project at INPE Plasma Laboratory was devised with the main purpose of designing, constructing and operating a high power microwave radiation source. In order to aim this goal, it was necessary to employ and handle special technologies as, for instance, high-voltage switching and pulsed power techniques. In particular, for the gyrotron experiment a high-voltage pulse modulator was built at INPE in a circuit category known as hard-tube pulser to provide the input electron bean power.

Inicialmente deriva-se as equacoes generalizadas de Zakharov e baseando-se nelas estuda-se os processos de instabilidade parametrica hibrida envolvendo a geracao de ondas de Langmuir, ondas eletromagneticas e ondas ion acusticas por duas ondas indutoras de Langmuir contra-propagantes com amplitudes diferentes atraves de uma relacao de dispersao acoplada. A seguir, partindo das equacoes generalizadas de Zakharov desenvolve-se, teorias lineares e nao lineares de modos acoplados de tres e quatro ondas, respectivamente. Nos processos de tres ondas, uma onda de Langmuir decae em outra onda de Langmuir e uma onda de ion acustica (decaimento parametrico eletrostatico) ou em uma onda eletromagnetica e uma onda ion acustica (decaimneto parametrico eletromagnetico). Nos processos de quatro ondas, ou modulacionais, a interacao envolve dois tripletos de ondas: no tripleto de decaimento a onda indutora interage com uma onda de baixa frequencia gerando uma onda Stokes, e no tripleto de fusao a interacao da onda indutora com uma onda de baixa frequencia gera uma onda anti-Stokes. Estes processos modulacionais sao processos convectivos e ressonantes cujos modos de baixa frequencia sao automodos do plasma e sao conhecidos como processos modulacionais estimulados. Quatro processos modulacionais estimulados sao investigados nesta tese: dois com ondas indutoras de Langmuir (processos modulacionais estimulados eletrostatico e hibrido) e os outros dois com ondas indutoras eletromagneticas (espalhamento Brillouin estimulado modulacional e processo modulacional estimulado eletromagnetico). Discute-se aplicacoes dos resultados teoricos em plasmas epaciais. Em particular, demonstra-se que os procesos de decaimentos parametricos eletrostatico e eletromagnetico de ondas Langmuir podem modelar a geracao e a modulacao de emissoes de radio e de ondas de Langmuir no vento solar, tanto no espaco interplanetario como na frente de choque de alguns planetas, e podem explicar algumas caracteristicas observacionais

   83:  Observacoes de fulguracoes solares com alta sensibilidade e altas resolucoes espectral e temporal na faixa de comprimentos de onda milimetricos sao escassas. Foi desenvolvido, pelo autor, um radiometro sensivel com resolucao espectral de 1GHz, operando dentro da faixa 18-23 GHz em conjunto com uma antena de 13,7m de diametro, a partir de fins de 1987, para observacoes de regioes ativas solares, e posteriormente modificado para efeturar observacoes de explosoes solares. Atualmente, o sinal em cada frequencia e medido durante 100 ms. A descricao detalhada desta instrumentacao incluindo o processo de calibracao, a aquisicao e o tratamento de dados sao fornecidos neste trabalho. Utilizando este instrumento o autor participou em campanhas internacionais de observacoes solares e registrou sessenta e sete grupos de explosoes solares, 9 destes observados simultaneamente com espectrometro de raios-X duros a bordo do satelite Solar Maximum Mission e 5 observados simultaneamente com o Frequency Agile Interferometer, operando na faixa de 1-18 GHz no Owens Valley Radio Observatory (CALTECH). Existem sugestoes de que fulguracoes solares sao compostas de fulguracoes menores designadas por "elementary flare bursts - EFB", com a contrapartida destas explosoes na banda de comprimentos de onda milimetricos conhecida como "explosoes simples" de duracao da ordem de segundos e exibindo um unico pico. A ocorrencia de tais explosoes e rara. Onze explosoes deste tipo foram investigadas em detalhes por seu comportamento espectral pela primeira vez. Os parametros observados destas explosoes sao os seguintes: tempo de subida medio de 4s e indice espectral variando entre -1,8 e -3,2, apresentando um comportamento temporal mole-duro-mole. O curto tempo de subida junto com o comportamento temporal do espectro sugerem que o mecanismo de aceleracao e injecao dos eletrons e de tipo impulsivo. As observacoes com alta resolucao espectral na parte opticamente fina dos espectros permitiram uma estimativa precisa do indice espectral. O indice espectral observado e o campo magnetico estimado sugerem que eletrons de alta energia (  200 keV) estao envolvidos na geracao destas explosoes. O possivel mecanismo de aceleracao e discutido. Os parametros da fonte (B=570G; E=100-300 KeV; N  = 10   - 10   eletrons e E  = 10  - 10  erg) de EFB sao semelhantes a "hot points", fizemos uma estimativa de primeira ordem da emissao em ondas milimetricas de tal tipo de fonte. Investigacoes simultaneas de 8 explosoes milimetricas complexas, exibindo mais do que um pico, com raios-X duros, foram efetuadas pela primeira vez com altas resolucoes espectral e temporal. Aqui, pela primeira vez mostramos pelo menos tres casos em que os picos de explosoes em comprimentos de onda milimetricos se correlacionam simultaneamente com os picos de alta energia (300 keV) observados em raios-X duros indicando que eletrons de energia mais alta ate 200-400 keV sao os responsaveis pela geracao das explosoes em comprimentos de onda milimetricos. Tambem estimamos os parametros de fontes de microondas e raios-X duros. Em um caso observamos a frequencia de pico permitindo uma estimativa mais precisa do campo magnetico e outros parametros de fontes. Os parametros medios da fonte de explosoes em raios-X e comprimentos de onda milimetricos sao os seguintes: B= 480 G, E= 200 keV, N= 10  - 10   cm  , NT= 10   - 10   eletrons e E  = 10   - 10   erg. A correlacao um-a-um em intensidade e tempo, e eletrons emissores em microondas com energia relativamente mais alta (200-300 keV) que a energia media daqueles emissores em raios-X duros, junto com o valor moderado do campo magnetico estimado (500 G) sugerem que duas populacoes de eletrons, de energias distintas, geradas ao mesmo tempo sao as responsaveis pela producao das explosoes em ondas milimetricas e raios-X. A discrepancia verificada para os numeros de eletrons emissores em microondas com aqueles produtores dos raios-X, com a sugestao acima, e o comportamento temporal de   para explosoes complexas favorecem a hipotese do modelo de aprisionamento com precipitacao de eletrons para as fontes milimetrica e de raios-X. Este modelo explica a repeticao da injecao de eletrons na fonte e o maior numero de eletrons emissores em microondas que encontram-se aprisionados nas partes mais altas das arcadas, bem como o numero relativamente menor daqueles que conseguem se precipitar para as partes mais baixas das arcadas gerando os raios-X duros observados. A semelhanca observada na evolucao temporal do indice espectral da parte opticamente fina do espectro de EFB e de explosoes complexas foi a mesma: mole-duro-mole. Alem disso, os parametros estimados para as fontes de EFB e explosoes complexas assumindo um mecanismo de emissao girossincrotron nao-termico sao da mesma ordem de grandeza o que sugere fortemente a hipotese de que as explosoes solares complexas sao compostas de muitos pequenos EFB, isto e, que a energia de fulguracoes solares e liberada em pequenos pacotes ou quantizada

   83:  Esta tese trata da obtencao do perfil de temperatura atmosferica entre 80 e 100 km de altura, regiao da mesopausa. Ela baseia-se no desenvolvimento e aprimoramento de uma tecnica experimental simples que permite determinar a temperatura da atmosfera utilizando um radar de laser e as propriedades fisicas do sodio mesosferico. A tecnica utiliza o radar de sintonizado na linha D  do sodio (5890   ) com um interferometro Fabry-Perot substituindo o espelho de saida do laser. O Fabry-Perot possui um "free-spectral-range" de 0,0198  , cujo valor e o mesmo da separacao da estrutura hiperfina da linha D  do sodio. Inicialmente um controlador de temperatura permite variar a temperatura do Fabry-Perot e realizar uma varredura em comprimento de onda na estrutura hiperfina do sodio. Posteriormente um Fabry-Perot controlado por pressao permite mudar o comprimento de onda do laser do maximo para o minimo da estrutura hiperfina. A temperatura do sodio, ou da atmosfera, uma vez que estao em equilibrio termodinamico, e inferida da convolucao entre o perfil do laser e o perfil ressonante do sodio. Os resultados obtidos sao comparados com as medidas de temperatura rotacional do OH e do O2 fornecidas por fotometros situados em Cachoeira Paulista

   83:  Minimum weigth design is an important criterion in aircraft and spacecraft because it allows either an increased pay-load or higher performance. As a result, the use of composite sandwich panels has grown due to their light  weight and high rigidity. In order to further increase the efficiency of these structures, designers have used different materials in different shapes in the facesheets and in the core. One of the most recent innovations has been the use of a uniform net of carbon fibre/epoxy as the facesheets. In the present study, the optimal design of sandwich plates with  heterogeneous facesheets is treated. The plate mass is minimized, considering the first natural frequency and certain failure loads as constraints. Weight reduction is obtained by defining a nonuniform distribution of composite material in the facesheets. Initially, the facesheets are assumed to be constructed of composite strips in a regular pattern. During the optimization process, both the widths of the strips and the spacing between them are varied to decrease the amount of material used. Such a design is conceptually straightforward to manufacture and, therefore, would lead to improved performance with little cost penalty. In order to solve this problem, it is first necessary to develop a computer code to determine the natural frequencies and the stresses in these plates. The bending and vibration problems for sanwich plates with heterogeneous facesheets are solved using the Ritz Method in conunction with the assumptions formulated by Reissner for sandwich plates. Since the sandwich plate considered in this study has facesheets constructed of nets and the computer code was developed to analyse laminates with heterogeneous continuous layers, it was necessary to use a produced to approximate the nonuniform net as a smoothed orthotropic heterogeneous continuum. The smoothing process is accomplished using the theory of homogenisation and the material coefficients were calculated using the Finite Element Method. Two approaches were considered to define the design variables of the problem: an independent design approach, in which the facesheet are discretized into regions with uniform design parameters; and a reduced basis formulation, in which the design is specified by a linear combination of orthogonal basis functions. This study solved the problem proposed. It has been demonstrated that variation in density is important and can lead to significant design improvement. Across of the face of the optimally designed plate, the density varies by a factor of 9. Also, the problems solved showed that the mass of the facesheets can be reduced up to 50

   83:  A densidade eletronica e um parametro muito importante para estudos geofisicos e para as telecomunicacoes trans-ionosfericas. O conhecimento previo da densidade eletronica e util em diversas aplicacoes, tais como radio-astronomia, geodesia espacial e navegacao de satelites e veiculos espacias. Os sistemas de GPS (Global Positioning System), que estao sendo amplamente utilizados nas mais diversas aplicacoes, necessitam de um modelo ionosferico preciso, para produzirem resultados de alta confiabilidade. Os modelos ionosfericos globais, tais como o IRI (International Reference Ionosphere), nao sao adequados para representar a densidade eletronica ionosferica na regiao em estudo. Sendo assim, este trabalho tem por objetivo criar um modelo ionosferico para prever o comportamento da ionosfera de baixas latitudes na regiao brasileira. Os dados utilizados foram obtidos entre 1990 e 1993, atraves de uma Digissonda instalada em Cachoeira Paulista. Foram utilizados os cinco dias magneticamente mais calmos de cada mes para formar a base de dados do modelo. Como a quantidade de dados nao era suficiete para se obter uma boa representatividade em uma base mensal, os dados foram agrupados em estacoes do ano. Alem disso, os dados nao estao uniformemente distribuidos em relacao ao numero de manchas solares. Uma vez que todos os coeficientes foram gerados e passaram a fazer parte de um banco de dados, o modelo consiste de um programa bastante simples, para o qual o usuario deve fornecer, como parametro de entrada, a "estacao do ano" e o "numero medio de manchas solares" do periodo em questao, e o modelo fornece, como saida, os valores horarios da densidade eletronica media, para a epoca solicitada, para as 24 horas do dia. Os resultados do modelo foram testados para alguns casos especificos, mostrando boa concordancia. Sugere-se a ampliacao da base de dados de entrada para se obter maior representatividade, tanto ao longo do ano (base mensal) quanto em termos de numero de manchas solares, para que o modelo possa ficar mais preciso

   83:  Ozone measurements have been made in Amazonia on several occasions and using different observation techniques. This paper describes a set of data taken on several aircraft flights in the Brazilian Cerrado region together with observations made at three Data Collecting Platforms (DCP) which measure ozone concentrations three times daily on average. This data set is therefore a merge of space and time observations of ozone, and the objective is to show the concentration differences over the biomass burning region of central Brazil. Diurnal variations are taken into account for observations made at different times of the day, and ozone sounding are used to account for height gradients. The data is therefore "corrected" for a given height, in this present case for 1500 feet (450 m) which is normally the first flight level of the INPE Bandeirante above ground. Ozone concentrations vary from as little as 20 ppbv (parts per billion per volume) away from source areas, to as much as 140 ppbv in areas influenced by biomass burning sources. The results are shown in a three dimensional longitude-latitude-ozone concentration surface

Topographic relief and degree of inundation divide the Pantanal into three main subregions: high elevatimi Pantanal "Alto Pantanal", middle elevation Panianal "medio Pantanal" and low-lying Pantanal "Baixo Pantanal". During the rainy season the water column changes from 30 cm to 2 m. Savana ("cerrado") is the main vegetation type. It has a tropic semihumid climate with an annual mean temperattire of 25 degrees C

A partir de Novembro de 1994, com a inauguracao do CPTEC, o Brasil vem realizando previsoes operacionais com seu modelo numerico, chamado Modelo Global do CPTEC/COLA. Em busca de melhores resultados e necessario aprimorar este modelo e, para isso, e preciso ter conhecimento do desempenho do mesmo. As estatisticas de desempenho sao geralmente obtidas para previsoes de variaveis simples, como Altura Geopotencial, Temperatura Virtual, Vento e Umidade Especifica. Neste trabalho aplica-se metodos comuns de estatistica para testar o desempenho do modelo para variaveis derivadas, tais como Divergencia, Vorticidade, Espessura, Adveccao Termica, Adveccao de Vorticidade, Convergencia de Fluxo de Umidade, Agua Precipitavel e Vetor Q. A performance das previsoes e testada em quatro estudos de caso. No primeiro caso faz-se uma comparacao das previsoes realizadas sobre as regioes tropical e extratropical do continente Sul-americano. Os demais estudos de caso destacam as diferencas entre as previsoes de variaveis simples e derivadas, assim como a previsibilidade da situacao sinotica de cada caso. Atraves de analise matematica demonstrou-se que, para alguns casos simples e hipoteticos, a correlacao entre variaveis simples e hipoteticos, a correlacao entre variaveis simples e diferente da correlacao entre variaveis derivadas. Notou-se que a onda de menor comprimento contribui mais para o valor da correlacao de variaveis derivadas. O estudo de caso 1 confirma que o modelo apresenta melhor performance sobre os extratropicos. A previsibilidade nos extratropicos, em termos da variavel geopotencial, e de 96 horas e nos tropicos a previsibilidade, em termos da variavel vento, e menos de 48 horas. Com os estudos de caso 2, 3 e 4, observou-se que o vento e melhor previsto para a situacao de ciclogenese e que a temperatura e melhor prevista para as situacoes de geada e neve. Observou-se tambem, em todos os casos e para todas as variaveis em geral, que a correlacao diminui e o erro quadratico medio e o desvio padrao aumentam com o prazo de previsao e, ainda, as previsoes de variaveis simples apresentam melhor ou igual performance que as previsoes de variaveis derivadas. Um resultado interessante, embora independente, e que a Agua Precipitavel tem melhor previsibilidade do que a umidade especifica, que apresenta previsoes uteis somente ate 24 horas. Atraves de comparacoes visuais entre previsao e analise, conclui-se que os criterios de validacao, apesar de serem simples, foram eficientes no intuito de aprovar ou nao as previsoes. Isto sugere que tais criterios sejam aplicados a outras situacoes de tempo, por exemplo, para uma situacao de Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul

   83:  A estrutura termodinamica da atmosfera sobre a Amazonia durante os experimentos FLUAMAZON (23/11-21/12/89) e RBLE-3 (13-25/08/94) e estudada no presente trabalho. Tem-se como objetivos estudar o perfil termodinamico da atmosfera envolvendo a Camada Limite Convectiva (CLC) e a Atmosfera Livre (AL), utilizando-se varias estacoes ao longo da Regiao Amazonica; e mostrar as caracteristicas encontradas sobre cada estacao apontando possiveis causas. Os dados de radiossondagens obtidos nestes experimentos sao estudados atraves da analise das variaveis conservativas, sugerida por Betts (1982). Os resultados obtidos em funcao do perfil vertical da pressao diferencial de saturacao (P), e da estrutura da Linha de Mistura (LM), mostram que a estrutura simples de tripla camada (Camada Sub-Saturada, Camada Saturada e Camada de Entranhamento) da CLC esta melhor caracterizada durante o RBLE-3. Referindo-se as estacoes do FLUAMAZON, sugere-se que as pequenas inversoes e os agrupamentos de Pontos de Saturacao (PS), observados proximos a superficie, podem ser devido a uma camada estavel noturna. Uma forte camada estavel encontrada nas estacoes de Alta Floresta e de Alcantara pode ser devida a downdrafts (corrente descendente) associados a sistemas meteorologicos de mesoescala. Em Oiapoque a presenca de uma forte camada estavel, em media troposfera, pode estar associada a sistemas meteorologicos de mesoescala e escala sinotica. Em geral, encontrou-se estruturas duplas, na LM, em todas as estacoes do experimento FLUAMAZON. Sugere-se que os processos combinados de precipitacao e evaporacao da precipitacao foram predominantes na formacao destas estruturas. Nota-se tambem que devido ao aumento do indice pluviometrico, os PSs tornam-se mais proximos entre si, em toda a LM. Associado a isto, a inclinacao da LM no diagrama (      ) e suavizada, ficando aproximadamente constante em relacao a   e. Isto sugere um grande aumento de energia calorifica em toda a coluna atmosferica analisada, devido a intensificacao dos movimentos convectivos. Na AL notou-se que os perfis medios de P, em ambos os experimentos, tendem a um valor comum, pouco maior que P   -10 mb. Observa-se, neste estudo, que o nivel de origem do ar subsidente no topo da CLC esta acima do nivel de resfriamento

Os padroes mostram a existencia de disturbios deslocando-se para oeste durante todo o ano mas com caracteristicas sazonais diferentes. Durante DJF os disturbios sao mais intensos no Hemisferio Sul, sendo o comprimento de onda de 6000 Km a 7000 Km e velocidade de fase de 10 m/s a 14 m/s. Durante JJA os disturbios sao mais intensos no Hemisferio Norte, sendo o comprimento de onda de 3500 Km a 4000 Km e velocidade de fase de 10 m/s a 13 m/s. Nas estacoes de transicao (SON e MAM) estes disturbios apresentam sinais tanto no Hemisferio Sul como no Hemisferio Norte. Dentre algumas caracteristicas destes disturbios, a inclinacao horizontal e de sudeste para noroeste durante SON e DJF, e e de sudoeste para nordeste durante MAM e JJA. Na vertical a inclinacao e ligeiramente para leste durante SON e DJF, e e para leste de 1000 hPa ate 700 hPa e para oeste de 700 hPa ate 500 hPa durante MAM eJJA. Os disturbios de leste apresentam suas maximas intensidades no nivel de 850 hPa. Foram encontrados indicacoes que estes disturbios poderiam estar relacionados com os furacoes do Hemisferio Norte durante JJA e SON. Nestes periodos a trajetoria dos disturbios e proxima daquela dos furacoes

   83:  Um Modelo Estatistico Dinamico de Media Zonal (MEDMZ), usando equacoes primitivas, e utilizado para estudar as variacoes sazonais da ZCIT e simular moncoes. No primeiro caso foram feitos tres experimentos: 1) utilizando os percentuais de terra e oceano existentes (controle); 2) considerando a area ocupada totalmente por oceano; e 3) assumindo a superficie coberta somente por continente. Em todos os experimentos foi verificada a circulacao media zonal tricelular. O deslocamento sazonal da ZCIT de verao para inverno e maior sobre o continente, como esperado. Os resultados revelaram, ainda, que a ZCIT desloca-se, em media, cerca de 25 graus sobre o continente; sobre os oceanos esse deslocamento se reduz a 15 graus; quando considerado o sistema terra-oceano como um todo o deslocamento e, tambem, de 15 graus. Sobre o oceano o deslocamento da ZCIT segue os maximos da temperatura a superficie do mar. E discutido o ciclo anual da precipitacao. A simulacao das moncoes e o resultado do aquecimento diferencial terra-oceano durante o ano. Neste experimento o Hemisferio Norte e totalmente coberto por continente e o Hemisferio Sul por oceano. As caracteristicas basicas dos moncoes sao bem simuladas. (inversao do vento e regimes de precipitacao) quando comparadas as observacoes. O comportamento climatico do Holoceno e simulado, alterando parametros orbitais da Terra e os resultados mostram uma intensificacao da circulacao monconica, concordando com as evidencias paleoclimaticas. Quando a resolucao do modelo e modificada, verifica-se que os resultados tendem a se aproximar da climatologia, a medida que o intervalo entre os pontos de grade diminui de 10 a 2.5 graus. Comparando os resultados com aqueles obtidos com um modelo mais complexo (circulacao geral) e um mais simples (balanco de energia), observa-se que o MEDMZ reproduz coerentemente as simulacoes

   83:  Neste trabalho foram estudados os padroes de circulacao associados aos vortices ciclonicos de altos niveis (VCAN's) sobre o Nordeste do Brasil e Atlantico Tropical Sul. Utilizou-se as analises diarias do modelo de previsao de tempo do ECMWF e imagens de satelite meteorologicos. Os resultados climatologicos para o periodo janeiro de 1980 - dezembro de 1989 confirmam que os VCAN's formam-se na alta troposfera, apresentando maxima vorticidade ciclonica em 200 hPa e um centro frio em 300 hPa. A maioria dos VCAN's origina-se sobre o Atlantico Tropical sendo mais frequentes nos meses de verao. Geralmente os VCAN's estendem-se para baixo ate 500 hPa, e raramente chegam ate 700 hPa. Eles inclinam-se com a altura para o oeste, e o centro frio esta localizado a leste ou sudeste do centro do vortice. O tempo de vida medio e de 7,1 dias. Nos anos de "El Nino" os VCAN's sao mais profundos na vertical, enquanto nos anos de "La Nina" sao confinados nos altos niveis. Confirmou-se que os VCAN's originam-se a partir da amplificacao da crista associada a Alta da Bolivia (AB). Essa amplificacao pode ser causada pela incursao de sistemas frontais de latitudes medias, ou por cavados do Pacifico Norte ou do Atlantico Norte que se alinham com a AB na direcao NW-SE ou NE-SW. Os VCAN's podem ter um deslocamento regular ou irregular. Cavados de latitudes medias associados a sistemas frontais e uma bifurcacao interhemisferica a noroeste da America do Sul podem causar deslocamento irregular. Para VCAN's com deslocamento regular e comum observar a presenca de um anticiclone nos altos niveis do Atlantico Sul relacionado com a Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul. O primeiro modo da analise das Funcoes Ortogonais Empiricas da vorticidade relativa em 200 hPa apresenta um padrao de ondas estendendo-se desde a costa leste sul americana ate o Atlantico Sul com orientacao SW-NE. Este modo representa o cavado de latitudes medias, crista amplificada e VCAN, sugerindo que ocorre transferencia de momentum e energia na direcao SW-NE. Para uma area menor inserida no dominio de estudo, o primeiro modo representa o VCAN sobre o oceano e para o segundo modo, o VCAN sobre o Nordeste. Mapas das correlacoes entre as amplitudes destes modos e as series temporais da vorticidade relativa filtrada para toda a area de estudo, indicam uma relacao entre o cavado do Pacifico Sul (120 graus W e 140 graus W) e o padrao de ondas no leste da America do Sul. Assim a presenca deste cavado teria alguma contribuicao na formacao do VCAN

   83:  O estudo da estratosfera nas ultimas decadas tem crescido significativamente, sendo que a maioria tem-se concentrado no hemisferio norte. Este trabalho teve como objetivo fazer uma analise da baixa estratosfera do hemisferio sul, mais especificamente o chamado aquecimento final estratosferico. Este fenomeno ocorre em ambos os hemisferios durante a primavera, estendendo-se, praticamente, durante todo o verao. Sao utilizados dados cobrindo um periodo de nove anos (1985 a 1993) entre as latitudes de 25 graus S e 85 graus S, nos niveis de 100, 70, 50, 30 e 10 hPa e nos meses de setembro a dezembro. Sao analisados o comportamento da temperatura e do vento medio zonal de setembro a dezembro, enfatizando-se as diferencas interanuais no comportamento destas variaveis. A decomposicao em serie de Fourier e empregada no ciclo de energia, como descrito por Saltzman (1957), em cada ano, nos periodos antes, durante e depois do aquecimento final estratosferico. Esta mesma analise e utilizada para os valores medios dos nove anos. O fluxo de calor e momentum assim como suas respectivas eficiencias sao estudadas ano a ano. Por fim utiliza-se o fluxo de Eliassen-Palm para estudar a atividade da estratosfera neste periodo. Destas analises conclui-se que a estratosfera apresenta grande variabilidade tanto no que se refere ao inicio do aquecimento quanto na sua intensidade. O aquecimento  final e caracterizado pela presenca de uma alta semi-estacionaria sobre o Pacifico Sul e por uma baixa sobre o Atlantico Sul. A estratosfera, em media, perdeu energia para a troposfera no termo do fluxo de energia geopotencial medio turbulento (   ). Tanto os fluxos de momentum como de calor se desintensificam a medida que o aquecimento o estratosferico progride, sendo que a eficiencia e maior durante o periodo do aquecimento. A componente vertical do fluxo de E-P e mais intensa nas medias latitudes e a componente meridional e mais intensa nas baixas latitudes. A onda-1 do fluxo de E-P apresenta uma periodicidade de 15 dias e a onda-2 de 7 dias

   83:  Neste trabalho investigou-se, sob o ponto de vista observacional, as caracteristicas dominantes da circulacao atmosferica de grande escala, desde a superficie ate os altos niveis da troposfera, durante os anos em que se observaram a manifestacao dos eventos do Padrao de Dipolo sobre a Bacia do Atlantico Tropical. Os eventos de Dipolo foram selecionados pelos anos que apresentaram o sinal contrario entre os indices normalizados de TSM computados nas Bacias Norte e Sul do Atlantico Tropical (Servain, 1991). Os resultados mais importantes das analises dos campos compostos mensais e sazonais, calculados para um total de 11 casos para cada fase positiva e negativa do Dipolo, foram os seguintes: As relacoes entre as variaveis oceanicas e atmosfericas na superficie do Atlantico concordaram com os estudos anteriores (Hastenrath e Heller, 1977; Nobre, 1993; Nobre e Shukla, 1996) e o gradiente termico norte-sul e inter-hemisferico modulou o posicionamento da banda de nebulosidade e precipitacao associada a Zona de Convergencia Intertropical e, consequentemente, as anomalias de precipitacao durante os meses da pre-estacao e estacao chuvosa do setor norte do Nordeste Brasileiro. As analises observacionais da circulacao atmosferica em altitude evidenciaram a manifestacao da circulacao meridional anomala e termicamente direta simulada por Moura e Shukla (1981). Durante a fase de desenvolvimento dos eventos de Dipolo observados sobre a Bacia do Atlantico Tropical, os fluxos das radiacoes de onda curta e longa e os fluxos de calor latente (associado aos processos evaparativos da agua oceanica) agem cooperativamente para a genese e manutencao do padrao inverso de anomalias de TSM relacionado com os eventos do Dipolo

   83:  Este trabalho apresenta um levantamento climatologico dos vortices ciclonicos em altos niveis (VCAN) que se formam no Oceano Pacifico Sudeste e atuam no sul da America do Sul. Alem disso, para diagnosticar as principais caracteristicas fisicas associadas, foi feito um estudo de caso para um evento ocorrido entre 03 e 05 de marco de 1987. As analises foram feitas utilizando-se imagens transmitidas pelo satelite meteorologico GOES-E e dados em ponto de grade gerados pelo European Centre for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), para o periodo de janeiro de 1980 a dezembro de 1989. A analise climatologica foi feita identificando a configuracao, o tipo e o deslocamento da nebulosidade associada ao sistema, durante o periodo considerado. Os resultados mostram que os VCAN formam-se durante todo o ano, deslocando-se para leste e ao cruzar os Andes 38
   83:   dissipam-se. A maior frequencia de formacao ocorre na estacao de inverno e a menor no verao. Esses resultados sugerem que esses VCAN sao do tipo Palmen e, que a instabilidade baroclinica seja um dos principais mecanismos de formacao. O estudo de caso baseou-se em analises do campo de vento, temperatura, umidade relativa e pressao em coordenadas isentropicas e isobaricas. Observou-se que o VCAN se formou devido a uma bifurcacao do escoamento nos altos niveis no Pacifico apresentando um ciclo de vida semelhante ao disturbios baroclinicos. Analises isentropicas revelam que associada a intensificacao do VCAN observa-se ventos de norte, provenientes do Brasil Central, relativamente forte nos baixos niveis, ascencao de ar quente e umido, subsidencia de ar frio e anomalias negativas de vorticidade potencial isentropica

   87:  CAVADOS INVERTIDOS
   82:  <AMERICA DO SUL>
   83:  Cavados que se formam no escoamento de leste sao ditos invertidos. Exemplo classico de cavado invertido (CI) sao as ondas de leste. Os CIs que formam-se em latitudes subtropicais e extratropicais da America do Sul ainda nao sao bem entendidos. Uma climatologia de sua ocorrencia, movimento e evolucao nas regioes subtropicais da America do Sul e obtida neste estudo. Cartas de superficie para um periodo de dez anos, 1980-1989, foram examinadas para estabelecer as caracteristicas destes CIs. Um criterio baseado no Laplaciano de pressao e usado para identificar os cavados nas cartas de superficie. A media mensal de ocorrencia de CIs mostra que eles sao mais frequentes na primavera e inicio do verao. Sobre a America do Sul, eles apresentam-se, mais frequentemente, na faixa entre 15 a 25 graus S no inverno e na faixa entre 20 a 35 graus S, no verao. Dois tipos de situacao sinotica sao identificadas: 1. CI ao norte de 20 graus S, nos ventos de leste tropical, provavelmente associado com o aquecimento continental no verao e 2. CI na parte norte do centro de anticiclones migratorios na retaguarda de uma frente fria. Os eixos dos cavados na superficie, mostram na climatologia uma preferencia por inclinacao no sentido NW-SE (45
   83:  ). Entretanto um numero significante (26,9
   83:  ) mostra uma orientacao meridional e o restante tem orientacao NE-SW. A maioria dos CI nao causam condicoes severas de tempo. Entretanto alguns poucos, quando associados a adveccao de vorticidade relativa na media troposfera, evoluem para baixas fechadas no Atlantico Sul na costa do Sul do Brasil. Alguns cavados nas celulas de altas pressoes frias, embora raramente, causam neve nas regioes serranas do Sul do Brasil. A evolucao temporal de quatro CIs, bastante distintos em suas caracteristicas, sao apresentadas como estudo de casos com a ajuda de dados em pontos de grade analisados pelo European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Os CIs apresentam ciclo de vida de cerca de tres dias e uma escala horizontal de 1000 Km. Sao bastante rasos, basicamente limitados aos ventos de leste em baixos niveis. Uma analise qualitativa do balanco da equacao da vorticidade relativa na regiao central de um CI (03 de marco de 1982) mostra que o termo de adveccao e tilting nao sao importantes e que os termos de divergencia e adveccao vertical contribuem para a ciclogenese. A tendencia de pressao a superficie, baseada nos campos de divergencia revelam a deficiencia dos dados disponiveis

   83:  Neste trabalho realizou-se uma climatologia do fenomeno bloqueio no HS, utilizando-se 14 anos de dados do ECMWF (1980-1993). Os resultados mostram quatro regioes preferidas para formacao de bloqueios: regiao da Australia e Nova Zelandia (Oceano Pacifico), Oceano Atlantico (10 graus W a 70 graus W), Oceano Indico (70 graus E a 120 graus E) e sudeste do Oceano Pacifico (80 graus W a 120 graus W). Esta ultima, e uma regiao que foi verificada neste estudo como regiao de formacao de bloqueios. Encontrou-se as maiores frequencias de bloqueios no inverno e menores no verao. Observou-se uma acentuada variacao interanual de frequencia de bloqueios, principalmente na regiao da Australia e Nova Zelandia, encontrando-se as maiores frequencias geralmente em anos de La Nina e menores em anos de El Nino. Discutiu-se as possiveis causas quanto a variacao interanual e a predominancia em anos de La Nina. A bifurcacao climatologica do vento zonal sobre a regiao da Australia e Nova Zelandia e mais forte e melhor definida em anos com maiores frequencias de bloqueios. Observou-se as caracteristicas de uma situacao de bloqueio de longa duracao atraves do estudo de caso, onde este se formou no sudeste do Oceano Pacifico. Os mecanismos fisicos de manutencao sao discutidos atraves do fluxo de Eliassen-Palm e de sua energetica local. Os disturbios transientes barotropicos agem para acelerar o fluxo no jato polar e desacelerar na regiao do bloqueio e na bifurcacao do jato de oeste, e assim, manter o bloqueio. A contribuicao da interacao de tres escalas temporais e avaliada atraves da energetica na regiao do bloqueio. A interacao deste fenomeno (componente intrasazonal) com os disturbios de alta frequencia e relativamente importante, sendo mais relevante a interacao do bloqueio com o fluxo sazonal. Visto que o bloqueio extrai energia cinetica barotropica do fluxo difluente sob a influencia de um campo de deformacao deste fenomeno. A instabilidade baroclinica redistribui esta energia na regiao do bloqueio

   83:  O "Buraco" na camada de ozonio e uma realidade para as localidades proximas ao Polo Sul. Durante episodios do fenomeno do buraco da camada de ozonio, na primavera local, a coluna de ozonio pode diminuir em mais de 50
   83:  , durante varios dias, e nestas ocasioes, a radiacao UV-B, danosa aos seres vivos, aumenta. A regiao habitada fisicamente mais proxima, da regiao do buraco, e a cidade de Punta Arenas, Chile, com 100.000 habitantes. Neste trabalho faz-se um levantamento quantitativo da coluna de ozonio em Punta Arenas, resultado de uma colaboracao especial entre o INPE e a Universidade de Magallanes, UMAG, desta cidade. O periodo deste trabalho inclui os anos de 1992, 1993, e 1994. Para obter dados nesta localidade o INPE instalou na UMAG um espectrofotometro Brewer. A grande vantagem do instrumento Brewer, alem de ser um instrumento todo moderno e automatizado, e a sua capacidade de medir radiacao UV-B simultaneamente ao ozonio. A partir de dados disponiveis obtidos pelo instrumento TOMS a bordo do satelite Nimbus 7, obteve-se uma climatologia para Punta Arenas. Os dados obtidos em Punta Arenas sao comparados com esta climatologia de ozonio de 15 anos. A climatologia obtida dos dados da NASA mostra, globalmente, uma queda na coluna de ozonio entre 1978 e 1992, de -0,4
   83:   por ano. Para a latitude de Punta Arenas, a media anual aumenta para -1,3
   83:   ao ano, considerando as medias do mes de outubro, e de -0,82
   83:   ao ano, se considerarmos as medias anuais. Isto demonstra claramente que Punta Arenas tem influencias fortes relacionadas com o buraco de ozonio da Antartica. Como exemplo de casos extremos de coluna de ozonio muito reduzidas, citamos os dias 27 de setembro de 1993, com 205,9 UD (Unidades Dobson); 5 de outubro de 1992, com 209,3 UD; 17 de outubro de 1994, com 145,8 UD; e 10 de novembro de 1994, com 204,6 UD. Comprova-se grandes aumentos de radiacao UV-B por ocasiao das reducoes de ozonio. No entanto, os valores excepcionais observados nestas ocasioes ainda nao sao maiores do que os valores normais medidos no periodo do verao, e sao menores tambem do que niveis normalmente observados na estacao de baixa latitude Natal (6 graus S), no Brasil

Tambem e apresentado um sistema de varredura para a otica de colecao da luz espalhada. O diagnostico de ET mesmo sendo uma tecnica muito dificil de ser implantada devido a baixa relacao entre o numero de fotons espalhados e incidentes (em geral 10-14 para tokamaks) continua sendo o metodo mais empregado na determinacao da densidade e temperatura eletronica do plasma por apresentar alta resolucao espacial e temporal e por nao pertubar o plasma. Primeiramente sera esbocado em linhas gerais a teoria de ET (Cap. 2) juntamente com as espectativas de sinais para o ETE. No Cap. 3 sao fornecidas as dimensoes e parametros basicos da maquina e no Cap.4 o projeto preliminar detalhado para o ETE e apresentado. Todos os desenhos foram realizados no AutoCad e estao todos em escala. Todas as medidas estao em milimetros. Este trabalho foi realizado com o apoio financeiro do CNPq

   83:  The MASCO project consists of an astronomical experiment designed to investigate X and Gamma rays in our galaxy. A telescope will be used to measure these rays. The telescope and the equipments are supported by a truss structure. The truss structure with the telescope and the equipments will be lifted with a stratospheric balloon to an altitude around 40 Km. After the experiments have been executed the MASCO structure will be released from the balloon. A parachute is foreseen to minimize the velocity at impact. The structure and telescope shall survive the landing loads. It is important to minimize the mass of the structure because a lower mass means a lighter and smaller balloon and lighter and less expensive ground equipment (e.g. trucks needed to hold the balloon during inflation). By using the optimizer available in MSC/NASTRAN a mass reduction of the MASCO-structure of around 30 
   83:   is obtained. The total mass of the proposed structure after optimization is 179 Kg (previous estimate 300 Kg). In the optimization program 15 design variables are selected. Seven representing widths of squared cross section BARS, seven representing wall thicknesses and one representing a platform thickness. The BAR dimensions finally selected have been defined according to a Brazilian supplier standard sizes. Using a optimization tool available in MSC/NASTRAN has several advantages with respect to a 'standard finite element analysis': 1) The optimizer prints retained analysis responses that are within a certain specified percentage of the allowable value. The corresponding critical elements are also printed. This automates the search for critical locations thus making investigation of the analysis results much easier. 2) The optimizer allows the user to define equations that can for instance represent a certain analysis response that normally would not be calculated (e.g. Euler- or local buckling equations). 3) The optimizer allows control of responses like allowable displacements that otherwise could only be realized with a time consuming iterative process

   83:  Within the framework of the project concerning the study and the realization of the Scientific satellite SACI-1, an opportunity was offered to develop a model of the satellite's structure, using the finite element method (MSC/NASTRAN code). For this, different models of the satellite were conceived and studied by the finite element method, in order to end at a model that came the most up the real structure. This problem was interesting for two reasons. The first was to have the opportunity to analyse the SACI-1 satellite (frequencies, vibration modes, etc.) without the need of practical tests on the real structure. Indeed, such analysis are expensive and difficult to realize considering the encumber of the satellite. Secondly , the gain of numerical models of the SACI-1 structure permitted to get experience and to conserve a databank useful for future similar projects. A reduced structure, composed only of some elements of the entire model, was studied in order to solve this problem. It permitted, in parallel, to effect some practical tests on the real structure and so, to compare the numerical results with the measurements ones. It was proceeded by successive iterations, where at each step, a model was formed, a numerical analysis was performed and a comparison with the results of the tests was done. In this report you will find a more precise description of the structure of the satellite (cf. Paragraph 1.2 Page 2) and of the structure studied (cf. Paragraph 2.1 Page 4). You will find too, a description of the goal of the project (cf. Paragraph 2.3 Page 5), of the followed method (cf. Paragraph 3 Page 6), as also a description of the different models studied and the obtained results (cf. Paragraph 4 Page 8). You will find also, in the appendixes, the graphs and the plots of the deformed structures referrring to the different models

   83:  Este trabalho aborda o papel da ressurgencia costeira na circulacao atmosferica local na regiao de Cabo Frio (RJ). Para tal, foi utilizado um modelo numerico tridimensional, nao-linear, de equacoes primitivas, que simula as circulacoes atmosfericas locais. Foram realizados experimentos considerando as situacoes de verao (quando ocorre ressurgencia) e de inverno (quando nao ocorre ressurgencia). Os resultados mostraram que a circulacao da brisa maritima e intensificada na presenca de ressurgencia gracas ao maior contraste termico continente-oceano. A comparacao dos resultados com dados observados na regiao de estudo mostrou uma boa concordancia das simulacoes com as observacoes

   83:  As explosoes decimetricas tipo III sao geradas proximas a regiao de aceleracao das particulas e de liberacao de energia para os "flares" na fase impulsiva. Portanto, investigacoes destas ajudam o conhecimento do processo de aceleracao. Sao analisados os espectros dinamicos de explosoes decimetricas (100-3000 MHz) detectadas em 13 flares pelo Radio Espectrografo PHOENIX (Suica). E feita a classificacao destas explosoes em tipo III, "spike" e "patch", e apresentado um catalogo. A analise das explosoes tipo III apresentou os seguintes resultados: a maioria das explosoes tem menos do que 250 MHz de faixa de frequencia; a duracao a meia altura e dada por: t 1/2 = 1.7 x 10  f   ; ha um decrescimo do numero de explosoes com o aumento da frequencia e do fluxo; o fluxo decresce para frequencias maiores; das 160 explosoes analisadas, 102 casos (67
   83:  ) foram "reverse slope" 52 casos (36
   83:  ) normais, e 8 casos (5
   83:  ) foram pares de explosoes bi-direcionais; encontramos a seguinte relacao entre taxa de deriva e frequencia:   (df/dt)  = 0.09 f   ; a velocidade media do excitador das explosoes tipo III e    = 0.16c; a emissao no harmonico e predominante na faixa decimetrica; a densidade numerica media (  ) e o numero de eletrons (N) para o feixe emissor sao     6 x 10  cm  e N   6 x 10  eletrons, respectivamente; a regiao de aceleracao pode apresentar densidades eletronicas de n    10  - 10  cm  , e estar localizada a alturas h  10  10  Km acima da fotosfera; inferimos limites superiores para a extensao da regiao de aceleracao de    h   400 - 4000 km e para a escala temporal de aceleracao das particulas de   < 0.5 - 5 ms. Tambem e apresentado um "software" para detecao e classificacao preliminar de explosoes tipo III e "spikes", e e proposto o formato FITS para os dados digitais do Espectrografo WDDHRS do INPE

   83:  Medicoes da coluna total de ozonio e da radiacao UV-B (280 - 320 nm) estao sendo realizadas desde julho de 1992 em Punta Arenas, Chile, num esforco conjunto entre a Universidade de Magallanes - UMAG, Chile e o Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE, Brasil. Punta Arenas e uma cidade de aproximadamente 100.000 habitantes, que se encontra em uma regiao perto da Antartica (53,2 S, 70,9 W), onde o buraco na camada de ozonio aparece ja ha varios anos com o inicio da primavera austral. A partir de outubro de 1992 tem-se observado em alguns dias a passagem do buraco de ozonio sobre esta regiao, registrando-se niveis muito baixos de ozonio de ate 145,8 UD (Unidades Dobson) em outubro de 1994. Cada vez que o buraco apareceu na regiao de Magallanes, os niveis da radiacao UV-B aumentaram de modo consideravel. Neste trabalho faz-se um estudo quantitativo da radiacao UV-B a fim de avaliar estes incrementos e compara-se com medicoes feitas em outras localidades. As medicoes foram obtidas utilizando principalmente o espectrofotometro Brewer, instrumento que tem a capacidade de medir a coluna total de ozonio e a radiacao UV-B que atinge a superficie. Os dados de UV-B de Punta Arenas mostram um incremento desta radiacao de ate 109
   83:   no dia 04 de outubro de 1992, ocasiao na qual o ozonio total diminuiu 33
   83:   em relacao a media movel (n=17). Em 1993, a radiacao UV-B aumentou 70
   83:   no dia 27 de setembro quando a quantidade total de ozonio diminuiu 26
   83:  , enquanto no ano 1995 o incremento da radiacao UV-B foi de 94
   83:   no dia 12 de outubro quando, por ocasiao da passagem do buraco sobre a regiao, a quantidade total de ozonio diminui 30
   83:  . A analise espectral das intensidades de radiacao UV-B nos dias antes assinalados mostram um maior aumento na faixa de comprimentos de onda entre 295 e 297 nm, sendo de ate 35 vezes maior do que em dias do mesmo mes nos quais as condicoes de ozonio sao "normais". Na faixa de comprimentos de onda entre 295 e 300 nm produz-se maior incremento das intensidades ponderadas pelos espectros de acao do Eritema, DNA e dano em Plantas, sendo na media de 4 ate 7 vezes maior que na faixa de 300 ate 315 nm. No entanto, os valores aumentados de UV-B observados, nao sao ainda maiores aos registrados nos meses de verao em Punta Arenas, e sao tambem menores que os observados em Natal (5,8 S, 35,2 W), Brasil

Estao incluidas algumas caracteristicas dos relampagos nuvem-solo tais como a polaridade, a multiplicidade, a intensidade de corrente da primeira e das subsequentes descargas de retorno, bem como as distribuicoes temporais e espaciais. Cerca de 300.000 relampagos foram medidos pelo sitema de deteccao de relampago LPATS sendo associados a Sistemas de Mesoescala (MCS) identificados pelo satelite geoestacionario europeu METEOSAT-3. Alguns resultados peculiares, como os relampagos negativos com alta intensidade de corrente media, 40 kA, e a alta percentagem de relampagos positivos, 35
   83:  , serao discutidos aqui. Esses resultados indicam diferencas na estrutura eletrica das nuvens nessa regiao. Portanto, sugere-se uma teoria que poderia explicar esse fato

   83:  Neste trabalho, o modelo ionosferico SUPIM (Sheffield University Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model) e utilizado para calcular os parametros ionosfericos foF2 e hmF2, e os resultados do modelo sao comparados com dados de ionossondas registrados em Huancayo, Peru, em Fortaleza e em Cachoeira Paulista, Brasil. Os parametros de entrada do SUPIM, tais como, fluxo solar EUV (Extremo Ultra-Violeta), campos eletricos e ventos termosfericos sao entao ajustados para que os resultados do modelo concordem com as observacoes. O estudo para Huancayo, o qual e feito para equinocio de atividade solar maxima, mostra que o fluxo solar EUV fornecido pelo modelo desenvolvido por Tobiska (1991) superestima o valor deste parametro em 40
   83:   e destaca a importancia do uso das derivas da mesma epoca que os dados ionosfericos a serem estudados por modelagens. A parte mais importante deste trabalho e um estudo da regiao F ionosferica na regiao do Brasil usando o modelo SUPIM e dados de h'F, foF2 e hmF2 registrados simultaneamente em Fortaleza e em Cachoeira Paulista. Neste estudo sao calculados a deriva equatorial E x B, o fluxo solar EUV, foF2, hmF2 e ventos termosfericos meridionais. Estes parametros sao calculados para periodos geomagneticamente calmos e para atividade solar minima e maxima. Para cada nivel de atividade solar e analisado o comportamento da regiao F durante verao e inverno. O fluxo solar EUV, produzido pelo modelo do Tobiska (1991), apresenta resultados inconsistentes apenas para verao de atividade solar minima, com valores subestimados em 25
   83:  . Sao incluidos os efeitos da Anomalia do Atlantico Sul sobre a ionosfera de Cachoeira Paulista no codigo do modelo SUPIM e os resultados mostram que estes efeitos apresentam variacoes sazonais, sendo despreziveis durante inverno. Em Fortaleza, os parametros foF2 e hmF2 apresentam sensiveis variacoes devido as mudancas da deriva E x B. Mas, entre 07:00 - 15:00 horas, o parametro hmF2 tambem e fortemente controlado pela combinacao de ventos e deriva. Em Cachoeira Paulista, os ventos locais controlam hmF2. Tambem sobre essa estacao, constatamos que foF2 apresenta dependencia significante dos ventos no seu ponto conjugado. E apresentado um estudo comparativo entre os ventos calculados neste trabalho (ventos ajustados), os ventos do modelo HWM90, os ventos calculados por Medeiros (1995) e os dados de ventos obtidos pelo metodo de interferometria de Fabry-Perot. Os resultados mostram boa concordancia dos ventos ajustados com os dados observados em Cachoeira Paulista e tambem mostram boa concordancia com os resultados de Medeiros (1995) durante a tarde e a noite, exceto, durante o inverno de atividade solar minima. Analisando as variacoes de foF2 com a latitude e com a hora local constatamos que a intensidade maxima do pico da Anomalia Equatorial forma-se mais cedo no hemisferio de inverno do que no hemisferio de verao

   83:  Apresentamos a contribuicao do autor nas duas primeiras etapas do desenvolvimento do Espectrografo Digital (100 canais) Decimetrico de Banda Larga (200-2500 MHz) de Alta Resolucao temporal (10-1000 ms) e espectral (3-10 MHz) e alta sensibilidade (2 ufs) (WDDHRS), unico no hemisferio sul, em operacao regular na sede do INPE, em Sao Jose dos Campos, desde maio de 1996. O WDDHRS se destaca por apresentar uma flexibilidade na escolha da banda de frequencia de observacao e das resolucoes temporal e espectral. Uma emissao solar tipo "patch" de banda estreita, apresentando separacao em duas componentes de frequencia e lenta taxa de deriva em frequencia, foi registrada pela primeira vez. Um mecanismo de emissao baseado na coalescencia entre ondas de Langmuir, excitadas por feixes de eletrons, e ondas acustico-ionicas e proposto, de acordo com as propriedades da emissao observada. Pela primeira vez, e apresentada uma analise estatistica de 102 explosoes solares tipo III, observadas na banda de (1600  50/100 MHz). As propriedades observadas sugerem que as explosoes tipo III decimetricas sao geradas pela interacao de feixe de eletrons no segundo harmonico. Dando continuidade a analise das explosoes decimetricas tipo III, foram analisadas em detalhes, 160 explosoes tipo III individuais observadas pelo Radio Espectrometro PHOENIX, a maioria das quais acima de 1000 MHz. O resultado mais importante e que 2/3 das explosoes analisadas apresentaram taxa de deriva em frequencia inversa. Considerando a energia media associada ao feixe de eletrons emissores e supondo que este perde sua energia preferencialmente por colisoes com o plasma ambiente, a altura de injecao dos eletrons acima da fotosfera foi estimada. O satelite YOHKOH oferece observacoes em raios-X cobrindo ampla faixa de energias com alta resolucao espectral. A analise de 13 "flares" solares em raios-X duros, associados com emissoes em radio, e apresentada para varios aspectos, tais como analise espectral, razao entre fluxo de fotons dependente da energia, imageamento das fontes em varias energias e associacao com explosoes tipo III. A evolucao temporal mostrou que o comportamento tipico dos espectros e "mole-duro-mole" e que geralmente sao melhor ajustados por uma lei de potencia dupla, com quebra para energias em torno de 100 keV. Energias mais altas sao defasadas em comparacao com baixas energias. A injecao/aceleracao devido a campos eletricos explica a maioria dos parametros da fonte observados e estimados. A investigacao da associacao entre emissoes em radio e raios-X duros mostrou que, em dois "flares", no inicio os raios-X sao melhor correlacionados com emissoes em baixas frequencias, no entanto, durante a evolucao dos "flares" a correlacao e melhor para altas frequencias, sugerindo que a regiao de aceleracao se desloca rumo a fotosfera. Em tres "flares" e mostrado que as radio emissoes ocorrem antes do pico de raios-X, confirmando as hipoteses de que as emissoes decimetricas ocorrem proximas a regiao de aceleracao. Baseado nestes resultados e sugerido um cenario para os "flares" solares em raios-X duros e radio frequencias decimetricas

   83:  Neste trabalho descrevem-se os sistemas detector e de imageamento do MASCO, um telescopio imageador de raios-  com alta resolucao angular e sensibilidade. Concebido para separar individualmente fontes presentes em campos densos, o MASCO torna-se ideal para o estudo de regioes como o Centro Galactico. Uma revisao dos resultados do estudo desta regiao com telescopios imageadores de raios-  e, assim, apresentada. Apresenta-se tambem a sensibilidade do MASCO para fontes pulsadas, tendo GX 1+4 como exemplo. O MASCO utiliza a tecnica de imageamento por abertura codificada, sendo o primeiro telescopio a utilizar um novo tipo de padrao para obtencao de mascaras codificadas, os arranjos uniformemente redundantes modificados (AURM). A tecnica de imageamento por abertura codificada e revisada e interessantes propriedades dos AURM discutidas. Este trabalho traz uma contribuicao original no que diz respeito aos AURM: a elaboracao de uma regra empirica que permite dizer qual padrao AURM e apropriado para se construir uma mascara codificada quando se deseja utilizar o metodo de imageamento com mascara-antimascara. O conceito de centro de rotacao de um padrao AURM e apresentado, tambem como contribuicao inedita. O MASCO utiliza uma serie de detectores de cintilacao. O detector principal do experimento e um cintilador de NaI(Tl) de 41 cm de diametro, 5 cm de espessura, construido em uma configuracao do tipo camara de Anger, com resolucao em energia de cerca de 10
   83:   em 662 keV. Detectores cintiladores organicos sao utilizados para se deduzir o nivel do ruido de fundo e, dentre estes, os de grande volume foram construidos pela primeira vez no Brasil. O MASCO utiliza 12 destes detectores e neste trabalho sao descritos os processos de fabricacao e sao mostrados testes com 2 tipos distintos destes cintiladores. O MASCO tera uma resolucao angular de 14' em um campo de visada de 14  e uma resolucao temporal de 20  s. A sensibilidade estimada do telescopio e de 5,46  10  fotons cm  s  keV  em 300 keV, para uma atmosfera residual de 3,5 g cm  e um tempo de integracao de 10  s. Como forma de prever o comportamento final do telescopio, uma imagem simulada da regiao do Centro Galactico, na faixa de 50-150 keV, e apresentada. Apresentam-se os resultados de testes preliminares obtidos com os sistemas de deteccao e imageamento e tambem as primeiras imagens de laboratorio do experimento, outra contribuicao inedita deste trabalho, pois estas sao, ate o presente, as unicas imagens obtidas com o auxilio de uma mascara codificada construida a partir de um padrao AURM

   83:  Este trabalho investiga o uso de redes neurais em controle de atitude de satelites artificiais. Com a intencao de validar esta aplicacao, optou-se por um satelite que nao fosse constituido por um corpo rigido, mas que possuisse um comportamento dinamico variavel em funcao de apendices articulados. A dinamica assim gerada tem o carater nao-linear tipico para utilizacao de redes neurais. Sao apresentados neste trabalho as principais relacoes que permitem a modelagem de um sistema via rede neural, bem como duas possibilidades de treinamento: retro-propagacao e minimos quadrados. Foram obtidas tambem as relacoes dinamicas e cinematicas do movimento de um corpo no espaco com apendices articulados, levando-se em conta a posicao do centro de massa e a variacao do momento de inercia do conjunto, necessarios para efetuar a simulacao do movimento do satelite. Para validar o controlador de rede neural, foi utilizado como exemplo a geometria do satelite de sensoriamento remoto da MECB, durante a fase de abertura dos paineis solares, que fazem as vezes dos apendices articulados. Inicialmente obteve-se o modelo de identificacao, contendo a dinamica direta do satelite. Posteriormente testaram-se varias formas de obtencao do modelo dinamico inverso atraves da rede neural, sendo que o treinamento com realimentacao do erro mostrou os melhores resultados. Para validar o controle, promoveu-se uma variacao de parametros do satelite (momentos de inercia, massa, empuxo dos motores) e incluiram-se de ruidos nos sensores, sem entretanto refazer o treinamento da rede. Comprovou-se, assim, que a rede possui capacidade de compensacao, capaz de assegurar robustez ao controle proposto

   83:  Neste trabalho, o problema de transferencia de um veiculo espacial entre duas orbitas elipticas nao coplanares dadas, atraves da aplicacao de dois impulsos, com consumo minimo de combustivel e resolvido em dois casos diferentes: i) considerando uma dinamica kepleriana para o movimento do veiculo espacial; e ii) considerando uma dinamica nao kepleriana (potencial gravitacional terrestre nao uniforme e arrasto atmosferico). Neste ultimo caso o problema e resolvido transformando-o no Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). Foi desenvolvido um novo metodo de calculo e um programa que utiliza as equacoes analiticas desenvolvidas neste metodo para gerar uma estimativa inicial para o programa que resolve o TPBVP. O software desenvolvido para gerar transferencias orbitais em dinamica kepleriana sera utilizado pelo INPE em futuras missoes espaciais, inclusive a missao do satelite China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS). Foram geradas e analisadas varias simulacoes para se observar o comportamento orbital de um veiculo espacial sujeito a diferentes perturbacoes e vinculos, no que diz respeito ao consumo de combustivel

   83:  Neste trabalho, investigou-se o desempenho do sistema de controle de um satelite artificial durante o procedimento de transferencia de orbita e no modo normal de operacao, o qual e caracterizado pelo apontamento de um de seus eixos para o Sol. No procedimento de transferencia as forcas e os torques envolvidos sao grandes, o que torna a presenca da flexibilidade no modelamento relevante, logo o modelo do satelite nesta fase e constituido por uma combinacao de um corpo rigido central e apendices flexiveis. Na fase normal de operacao, o satelite esta sujeito apenas a acao de torques de pequena magnitude nao afetando o movimento flexivel, portanto, o satelite e modelado como um corpo rigido. Na fase de transferencia, utilizou-se uma estrategia do tipo Hohmann e um controlador do tipo bang-bang. Nesta fase, os erros no controle da atitude, elementos orbitais, consumo de combustivel, influencia da resposta elastica no sistema de controle e comportamento dos apendices flexiveis foram analisados. Na fase normal de operacao, utilizou-se um controlador PD cujos ganhos foram determinados atraves do metodo da alocacao de polos. Nesta fase analisou-se o desempenho do sistema de controle quando sob o efeito da imprecisao dos sensores e de torques pertubadores devido ao arrasto atmosferico, a pressao de radiacao solar e residuos magneticos. As medidas dos sensores e dos giros foram processadas por um filtro discreto de Kalman. Como resultado desta investigacao, foi possivel observar que as respostas elasticas influenciam o desempenho do sistema de controle o que sugere que no projeto de um sistema de controle utilize-se bandapassante de pelo menos uma decada abaixo da frequencia natural de vibracao o do flexivel. No apontamento, verificou-se que a precisao do apontamento e mais afetada pelos erros dos sensores que pela acao dos torques perturbadores, alem disso a imprecisao dos sensores e amenizada quando a taxa de amostragem e diminuida

   83:  A variety of moored, surface layer drifters, ship and satellite-based measurements have been collected since the Fall of 1992 as part of the COROAS (Circulacao Oceanica na Regiao Oeste do Atlantico Sul) project. Analysis of hydrographic, drifter and satellite data for the austral winter of 1993 has revealed the presence of a tongue of relatively cold (14-17 C) and low salinity (33.0-34.0) water between the coast and the Brazil Current, extending from south of the Rio de La Plata estuary (35 S) to latitudes as low as 23 S, with a typical average northbound velocity of 10.7 cm  s. These three data sets rule out the possibility that the origin of this water is river runoff or from deeper water upwelled near the coast, due to Ekman dynamics

   83:  Two series of prognostic experiments were conducted with a barotropic model. In one of them, the model was used for the calculation of long time series of streamfunction fields. These data were used for creating ensembles of the initial conditions and for the estimation of a forcing. The second series of the prognostic experiments were conducted with real data. The experiments were aimed at evaluating the prognostic ability of the barotropic model for long time period integration, and studying the influence of the lagged average forecast (LAF) technique on prediction errors. The experiments have shown that using LAF technique makes better the prediction skill of the model, and the predicted linear trend of time evolution of the atmospheric circulation has a positive skill beyond 10 days

   83:  O presente trabalho tem como objetivo calcular parametros (comprimento, periodo, velocidade de propagacao etc.) de ondas atmosfericas a partir de observacoes simultaneas de dados de intensidade e temperatura rotacional da aeroluminescencia (ou airglow) do OH (6,2), observado pelo fotometro FOTOH, e dados de vento observado pelo radar MU na regiao da mesopausa (entre 80 e 100 Km) em Shigaraki (35 N, 136 L), Japao. A determinacao dos parametros fisicos destas ondas permite obter informacoes a respeito da sua propagacao pela atmosfera alem de aumentar o conhecimento sobre a interacao destas ondas com o airglow. As observacoes ocorreram em novembro de 1994 e de julho a setembro de 1995. O fotometro foi construido no laboratorio Lume/INPE e tem como principal caracteristica a possibilidade de fazer medidas em 8 posicoes do ceu com resolucao temporal de 6 minutos. O radar MU consiste de 475 antenas distribuidas dentro de uma area circular de 108 m de diametro. No modo meteorico, o radar mede o vento a partir de tracos ionizados por meteoros ao entrar na atmosfera terrestre. Os resultados das analises das observacoes mostraram que varios dias apresentaram ondas propagando-se pela atmosfera e que foi possivel determinar alguns de seus parametros. As ondas caracterizadas neste trabalho ficaram compreendidas entre 500 e 2960  Km de comprimento horizontal e o periodo entre 3,5 e 9,5 h. Outros parametros determinados experimentalmente, tais como, velocidade, comprimento de onda vertical, estavam consistentes com modelos para ondas de gravidade. Alguns resultados mostraram que a diferenca entre periodo observado e periodo intrinseco eram praticamente iguais, porem, a noite de 29.07.95 apresentou uma diferenca de quase 100
   83:  . Para duas noites analisadas, foi determinado tambem, a presenca de duas ondas superpostas, mas, com caracteristicas bem distintas. A noite do dia, e.g., 04.11.94 mostrou a presenca de uma onda de curto periodo (3 horas) superposta a uma outra de longo periodo (9 horas). Foi observado uma diferenca de fase entre a intensidade e a temperatura rotacional em torno de 1,5 horas para as noites de 04.11.94 e 08.11.94

   83:  Um estudo com resultados pioneiros das caracteristicas eletrodinamicas da atmosfera brasileira foi realizado atraves de duas campanhas de medidas: a primeira em 26 de janeiro de 1994 e a segunda em 23 de marco de 1995. Estas campanhas contaram com o auxilio de radares meteorologicos, imagens meteorologicas de satelite, dados de radiossondagem e principalmente de baloes estratosfericos. A carga util dos baloes possuia sensores de campo eletrico, condutividade, temperatura, altitude, e na campanha de 1994, uma maquina fotografica e uma filmadora (instaladas pela primeira vez em um balao estratosferico com finalidade cientifica). A analise conjunta destes dados com dados meteorologicos permitiu: a obtencao do primeiro perfil de condutividade na America do Sul; entender melhor as causas da variacao da condutividade na estratosfera; determinar criterios para a definicao da polaridade de relampagos; tracar para os seus sferics uma relacao entre a amplitude e o tempo de decaimento e ainda estimar alguns parametros de blindagem de uma nuvem de tempestade

   83:  Descreve-se neste trabalho o desenvolvimento do sensor estelar SUE, um instrumento baseado em uma camara CCD com a capacidade de determinar as coordenadas celestes de apontamento com um erro menor do que 0,5 minuto de arco. O instrumento, que faz parte do sistema de determinacao de atitude do telescopio MASCO, adquire uma imagem do ceu a cada segundo, reconhece as estrelas mais brilhantes do campo observado, cria com elas uma "constelacao" e procura esse padrao dentro de um catalogo da regiao observada. Na configuracao basica, o sensor estelar consegue detectar estrelas com magnitude menor que 3,2. O algoritmo de procura utilizado baseia-se na analise da configuracao geometrica da "constelacao", considerando as distancias e os angulos entre as estrelas assim como os brilhos relativos. O sensor estelar, constituido por uma camara CCD a qual foi adaptada uma lente teleobjetiva, digitaliza as imagens com 512x400 pixels. Duas configuracoes basicas foram testadas: uma utilizando uma lente de foco variavel (18 a 108 mm) e outra utilizando uma lente de foco fixo (70 mm). A camara observa uma regiao de aproximadamente 6 x5 no ceu, o que gera uma resolucao, dada pelo numero de pixels no sensor, de  45 segundos de arco. A implementacao de algoritmos de interpolacao permitiu obter uma precisao na determinacao das coordenadas de apontamento de ate 1/10 de pixel ou, equivalentemente, alguns segundos de arco. Os testes feitos com o sensor geraram os seguintes resultados: dispersao menor que 4 segundos de arco na determinacao da posicao das imagens estelares, 100
   83:   de casamentos corretos de mais de 1500 padroes de pontos e dispersao do erro na determinacao das coordenadas de apontamento menor que 30 segundos de arco

   83:  O aumento da autonomia operacional dos satelites tem propiciado uma continua melhoria da performance e uma significativa reducao de custos operacionais. Neste trabalho e apresentado e discutido um novo algoritmo de controle baseado na logica nebulosa com o objetivo de controlar de forma autonoma um satelite estabilizado por rotacao via bobinas magneticas. Foram realizadas simulacoes com o objetivo de se avaliar o desempenho do controlador nebuloso diante de situacoes reais como: o ocultamento do sensor solar durante a revolucao orbital do satelite; e a utilizacao de um algoritmo simples para a determinacao das velocidades angulares do corpo. Nestas simulacoes observou-se e comparou-se de forma qualitativa e quantitativa a resposta dinamica do controlador nebuloso com a resposta dinamica do controlador convencional. O primeiro Satelite de Aplicacoes Cientificas Brasileiro - SACI1, que esta sendo construido pelo Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE, e uma das possiveis missoes que podem se beneficiar desta nova abordagem. As simulacoes mostraram que o controlador nebuloso atingiu as especificacoes sobre o controle estabelecidas para o satelite SACI1, levando o sistema as condicoes nominais de operacao, sendo ao mesmo tempo simples e robusto

   83:  Neste trabalho, o problema da transferencia orbital com minimo consumo de combustivel, mas com limite de tempo para esta transferencia e estudado para os casos bi-impulsivos coplanar e nao coplanar. Este limite de tempo impoe uma caracteristica nova ao problema, fazendo com que grande parte dos metodos existentes na literatura nao mais se apliquem. Assim sendo, para o caso coplanar utilizamos as equacoes apresentadas por Lawden em 1993, modificamos e resolvemos estas equacoes de forma a desenvolver um programa para manobras orbitais. O metodo original desenvolvido por Lawden foi apresentado sem resultados numericos e considera apenas o caso onde os pontos de inicio e fim da manobra sao conhecidos. O programa desenvolvido estende o metodo ao caso onde apenas um ponto e conhecido e ao caso onde os dois pontos sao livres. Ja para o caso nao coplanar, utilizamos as equacoes apresentadas por Eckel e Vinh em 1984, modificamos e resolvemos estas equacoes para, da mesma forma que no caso coplanar, desenvolver um programa para manobras orbitais. O metodo original apresentado por Eckel e Vinh so e valido para uma determinada geometria da manobra. Portanto, o programa desenvolvido estendeu a aplicacao deste metodo a casos de geometria mais complexa. As simulacoes mostraram que os programas desenvolvidos podem ser utilizados em aplicacoes reais e que eles sao capazes de gerar resultados confiaveis. Como era esperado, as simulacoes mostraram que, de uma forma geral, quanto menor o tempo de transferencia maior o consumo de combustivel. Contudo, as simulacoes sugerem haver descontinuidades no comportamento de alguns elementos orbitais o que dificultou a obtencao de solucoes. Alem dessas descontinuidades, as simulacoes tambem sugerem a existencia de mais de uma solucao para um mesmo valor de tempo, porem esta possibilidade nao foi comprovada

   83:  Um modelo de vegetacao, baseado no Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) foi acoplado a um modelo atmosferico estatistico-dinamico de media zonal, global, utilizando as equacoes primitivas, para possibilitar simulacoes, anual e sazonal, do clima medio zonal e de possiveis impactos climaticos gerados por alteracoes antropogenicas significativas na vegetacao. Inicialmente, foram efetuados testes de sensibilidade para aquilatar a resposta do modelo de vegetacao aos principais parametros intervenientes, considerando-se dois tipos de cobertura vegetal contrastantes: florestas perenifolias e gramineas baixas. Em seguida, foi testada a habilidade do modelo acoplado em reproduzir a climatologia media zonal observada. Para o computo das fracoes ocupadas por cada tipo de superficie (segundo o BATS), em cada cinturao de latitude, foi usada uma matriz de dados com a vegetacao dominante numa grade horizontal de 1  de latitude por 1  de longitude. Foram realizados tres experimentos de controle na simulacao da climatologia media zonal anual (1  ) e das medias sazonais de dezembro a fevereiro (2 ) e de junho a agosto (3  ). Usando a propriedade do modelo acoplado de possibilitar alteracoes da vegetacao em areas especificas da superficie terrestre, foram realizados experimentos de sensibilidade quanto ao desflorestamento na Amazonia e a desertificacao na Africa. O primeiro consistiu na substituicao da floresta tropical perenifolia por gramineas baixas, na faixa da America do Sul compreendida entre 10 N e 10 S; o segundo na degradacao da flora na faixa da Africa localizada entre 20 N e o equador, correspondendo a substituicao de semi-desertos por desertos, de gramineas altas e arbustos deciduos por semi-desertos e, ainda, da floresta tropical perenifolia por gramineas baixas. Nos experimentos de controle, o modelo acoplado simulou adequadamente as principais caracteristicas do comportamento da atmosfera, em termos medios zonais, medios anuais (1o. experimento) e medios sazonais (2o. e 3o. experimentos). Dentre os experimentos de alteracao da flora realizados, os de desmatamento da Amazonia (anual e sazonal) revelaram, quando comparados aos respectivos controles, tendencia a reducao do fluxo de calor latente para a atmosfera, com o coerente aumento no de calor sensivel e incremento na temperatura a superficie. Decremento na evaporacao e na precipitacao tambem foram obtidos. A degradacao da flora na Regiao Norte da Africa revelou tendencias medias anuais semelhantes. Os resultados, em ambos os casos, sao comparaveis aqueles oriundos de experimentos congeneres, realizados com modelos de circulacao geral, ressaltando a importancia de modelos de media zonal em estudos dessa natureza. Finalmente, a versao nao acoplada do modelo de vegetacao foi utilizada para simular medias diarias dos fluxos de energia, apresentando bons resultados, quando comparados aos dados coletados durante o Rondonia Boundary Layer Experiment 3 (RBLE 3), no contexto do Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observational Study (ABRACOS)

Considerou-se 5 anos de dados analisados diarios (1 nov. 1985 - 31 jan. 1991), globais, obtidos do NMC, as 12 UTC. O balanco de vorticidade incluindo os transientes nao foi muito definido. O balanco de energia cinetica mostrou que o ciclo de energia sobre a America do Sul, no verao, se da da seguinte forma: EPD para   , atraves do termo -      e, de   para   , principalmente atraves do termo de interacao          . O estudo de periodicidades nos parametros de energia cinetica mostrou varios tipos de oscilacoes: o ciclo anual, de 30-60 dias e oscilacoes de curto periodo, sugerindo a presenca de transientes. Na America do Sul, as interacoes entre as escalas sazonal e intrasazonal foram mais dominantes. A energia cinetica local mostrou o papel dos transientes na regiao do Cavado sobre o Atlantico Sul e das interacoes sazonais e intrasazonais na regiao da Alta da Bolivia. Maiores interacoes ocorreram proximo ou na regiao das Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul (ZCAS)

   83:  A major problem in computer animation is the amount of tedious work required to specify the positions of objects at each step of an animation sequence. This problem is extreme in the case of humanoid animation where several figures are required to move coherently in an environment. This thesis presents a framework for behavioural animation. The framework has been developed to deal with a multiplicity of autonomous robots which inhabit a dynamically changing environment. There is also a requirement that these robot  entities be capable of interacting with each other and reacting to changes in the environment. The assumption that the actions realised by these entities are goal-directed permits the specification of their behavior by simple but high-level commands called "instructions". The animator can therefore control the behavior of the robots by organising a set of instructions that they will perform as a script. However, because the robots possess a degree of autonomy, they can react to their imediate environment in the absence of specific directions from the animator. The high-level instructions are developed, by the system, as a hierarchy of sub-instructions, as events take place. This forms a mechanism for the automatic generation of complex animation sequences. The task of an animator is considerably simplified because it is not necessary to specify detailed behaviour. Such an approach provides the flexibility to re-use and to extend existing commands for a wider range of situations. This technique is explored using an example scenario with a variety of static objects and autonomous agents

   83:  Particle filtering and inverse synthetic aperture radar applied to manoeuvring targets. This report describes the application of optimal non-linear/non-Gaussian filtering to the radar signal processing problem. This approach, made feasible by a new technique named Particle Filtering, may cope with nonlinear models without any restrictions as well as non-Gaussian dynamic and observation noises. The main feature of the Particle Filtering is that it constructs the conditional probability of the state variables, with respect to the measurements, through a random exploration of the state variables, with respect to the measurements, through a random exploration of the state space by entities called particles. A weight is assigned to each particle by a Bayes correction term based on the measurements. The application of this new filter to the inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technique allows the joint estimation of the path and the image of a manoeuvring target in weak signal to noise ratio situations. The same algorithm can be used also to deal with the simpler problem of target tracking in presence of glint

   83:  In this work the orbit determination problem of an Earth artificial satellite is analyzed. This problem is solved using the GPS (Global Positioning System). It's assumed that the target satellite will carry a GPS receiver. To perform this mission, one needs to perform the following steps: i) To simulate the motion of the GPS and the target satellites; ii) To calculate all the distances between the GPS satellites and the target satellite; iii) To determine which GPS satellites are visible; iv) To corrupt those data by adding a random error; v) To develop a software that is able to get a navigation solution on each point of the orbit; vi) To develop a new software to get the target satellite state vector (position and velocity) from the navigation solution. This work was motivated by INPE's plans of performing this kind of mission in a near future. It must be emphasized that the goal of this work is not to provide the system maximum accuracy, but a sufficient accuracy to track and control the satellite at a low cost

   83:  The problem of transfer orbits from one body back to the same body (the moon or a planet) is formulated as a Lambert problem and solved by Gooding's Lambert routines . Elliptic and circular orbits are considered for the moon or a planet and any type of orbit (elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) is considered for the spacecraft. The solutions are plotted in terms of the true anomaly (instead of the eccentric anomaly) for several cases. The use of the true anomaly simplifies the solutions in several ways. The problem of transfers from this body to the corresponding L4 and L5 points is also solved. Next, the same problem is studied in terms of the   and the time required for the transfer. Among all of the possible transfer orbits, a small family with almost zero   was studied in detail. A transfer from the moon to the corresponding Lagrangian equilibrium points L  or L  is shown, as an example of a practical application of this theory

   83:  We consider the problem of minimum  time-free impulsive transfers between coplanar Keplerian orbits. We studied two types of maneuvers: the ones performed with two impulses and the ones performed with three or four impulses that go to infinity in the middle of the transfer. For the two-impulse maneuver, we develop optimality conditions that lead to a nonlinear system of three equations and three unknowns. For the three-impulse maneuver, we develop a new maneuver that uses two elliptic transfer orbits that are connected by a negligible impulse applied at an infinite distance from the attracting body. It is an extension of the bi-elliptic transfer, where the two orbits involved in the transfer are not coaxial. We study in detail and show regions of optimality for the most trivial cases of transfers: between two circular orbits, one circular and one elliptic orbit, and two elliptic coaxial orbits. We complete the research by studying a scheme to reduce the total   for some of those maneuvers, by adding a second impulse at infinity, and making it a four-impulse maneuver

   83:  This paper studies transfer orbits in the planar restricted three-body problem. In particular, we are searching for orbits that can be used in two situations: 1) to transfer a spacecraft from one body back to the same body (known in the literature as Henon's problem) and 2) to transfer a spacecraft from one body to the respective Lagrangian points L4 and L5 . To avoid numerical problems during close approaches, the global Lemaitre regularization is used. Under this model, Henon's problem becomes a Lambert three-body problem. After the simulations, we found orbits to transfer a spacecraft between any two points in the group formed by Earth and the Lagrangian points L3 , L4 , L5 (in the Earth-sun system) with near-zero   (near 10  in canonical units). We also found several orbits that can be used to make a tour to the Lagrangian  points for reconnaissance purposes with near-zero  for the entire tour. The method employed was to solve the two-point boundary value problem for each transfer using the results available from the two-body version of this problem as a first guess

   83:  The problem of applying an impulsive thrust in a spacecraft that is performing a swingby maneuver (also called gravity-assisted maneuver) is studied. The objective is to derive a set of analytical equations that can calculate the change in velocity, energy, and angular momentum for this maneuver as a function of the three usual parameters of the standard swingby maneuver plus the two parameters (the magnitude of the impulse and the angle between the impulse and the velocity of the spacecraft) that specify the planar impulse applied. The dynamics used to obtain those equations are given by the patched-conic approach. A study is also performed to find in which cases the impulse is more efficient when applied during that close approach or after that, in a two-step maneuver. After that, the same maneuvers are computed under the dynamics given by the restricted three-body problem, and the results are compared with the ones obtained previously under the patched-conic dynamics

   83:  The swing-by maneuver uses a close approach with a celestial body to modify the velocity, energy, and angular momentum of a spacecraft's orbit. The swing-by trajectories are studied and classified under the model given by the elliptic restricted three-body problem. Several simulations are made to show the effects of the eccentricity of the primaries in this maneuver. The position of the secondary in its orbit (specified by its true anomaly) also has effects on the results, and they are quantified. To show the results, the orbit of the spacecraft is classified in four groups: elliptic direct, elliptic retrograde, hyperbolic direct, and hyperbolic retrograde. Then the modification in the orbit of the spacecraft due to the close approach is shown in plots that specify from which group the spacecraft's orbit is coming and to which group it is going. Several families of orbits are found and shown in detail. An analysis about the trends as parameters vary is performed, and the influence of each of them is shown and explained. The results presented can also be used to find optimal sets of parameters for several types of problems, such as finding an escape orbit that has minimum velocity at periapsis and other related problems

   83:  In a continuation of previous research where the problem was studied for the Earth-sun system, we search for transfer orbits from one body back to the same body (known in the literature as Henon's problem) in the Earth-moon system. In particular, we are searching for orbits that can be used in three situations: 1) to transfer a spacecraft from the moon back to the moon (passing close to the Lagrangian point L3 in most of the cases); 2) to transfer a spacecraft from the moon to the respective Lagrangian points L3 , L4 , and L5 ; and 3) to transfer a spacecraft to an orbit that passes close to the moon and to the Earth several times, with the goal of building a transportation system between these two celestial bodies. The model used for the dynamics is the planar and circular restricted three-body problem. The global Lemaitre regularization is used to avoid numerical problems during close approaches. An interesting result that was obtained in this research is a family of transfer orbits from the moon back to the moon that requires an impulse with magnitude lower than the escape velocity from the moon

   88:  Earth-moon system
   83:  Several aspects of the time of flight involved in the problem of gravitational capture in the regularized, restricted three-body problem are studied. A gravitational capture occurs when a massless particle changes its two-body energy around one celestial body from positive to negative without the use of nongravitational forces. The importance of several parameters involved in a capture in the Earth-moon system is studied. In particular, the time required for the capture is studied under different initial conditions. This information is very important for mission designers for two reasons: 1) the time for gravitational capture has an impact in the duration of any mission that uses this technique; and 2) the gravitational capture is a very sensitive phenomenon and, if the time involved is too large, perturbations from different sources may influence the mission too much. The results show the existence or regions where the time for the capture is reduced by a factor close to 10 with an adequate choice of initial conditions, without the reduction of the energy savings. In addition, the results are used to solve a family of optimization problems, such as the problem of finding trajectories that can perform a gravitational capture in a minimum time with a fixed savings or with maximum savings with an upper time limit

   83:  This paper considers the problem of optimal rendezvous maneuvers between two space vehicles. The rendezvous is a space maneuver where a spacecraft, called the chaser, has to be transferred from its initial orbit to a final orbit where it has to reach and follow a second spacecraft, called the target. In the present research those two spacecrafts are supposed to be in Keplerian orbits around the Earth. Those two orbits can be coplanar or fully three-dimensional. The control available to perform this maneuver is the application of two impulses (instantaneous change in the velocity of the spacecraft) to the chaser vehicle

   83:  Daily 200-hPa relative vorticity data have been used to study the dominant patterns related to the cyclonic vortices over the South Atlantic Ocean in the vicinities of northeast Brazil, during the 1980-1989 period. Reference modes were obtained through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the 200-hPa filtered vorticity anomalies over northeast Brazil, considering all the southern hemisphere (SH) summers within the study period. The amplitude time series of the first reference mode, separately for each SH summer, was correlated with the corresponding filtered vorticity anomalies in a larger area extending from 20 N to 40 S and between 120 W and 20 W. The correlation patterns feature a wave-like structure along eastern South America, with three main centers: the first one, over the South Atlantic off the northeast Brazil coast, is associated with the cyclonic vortices; the second one, over eastern Brazil, represents the corresponding anomalously amplified ridges; and the third one, over southern Brazil/Uruguay, is related to the equatorward incursions of midlatitude upper level troughs. This wave-like pattern is consistent with with the vortex formation mechanism suggested in previous works. Another wave-like pattern southwest-northeast oriented is evident over the tropical southeastern Pacific, for some years. The interannual variability of these patterns is discussed in this paper

Fourier series were used to account for the periodic seasonal variations in the transition probabilities. All the regressions and tests, based on Generalized Linear Models, were made through the software GLIM. Significant seasonal variations were detected in the conditional probabilities, especially for the extreme categories of overcast and clear days. The fitted model provided a concise summary of the daily data, useful for short-range (1 day) sunshine predictions and simulations

   83:  A review of researches on the relationship between the tropical ocean sea surface temperatures (SST)and rainfall anomalies in Northeast Brazil was introduced. In this work, two neural network models are implemented to reconstruct and predict the time series of the SST in two regions: the tropical Atlantic ocean (Wright index, from 1854 to 1985) and the tropical Pacific ocean (regions Nino 1-2: 0 N-10 S, 270 E-280 E and Nino4: 5 N-5 S, 160 E-150  E, from 1950 to 1995). The selected neural networks include Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN). Both were implemented in the neural network stimulator SNNS. For the Wright index, the trained Backpropagation Neural Network successfully predicted the index of the following four months with the relative errors from 1.40 to 3.34
   83:  . For SST in Nino 1-2 and Nino4 regions, the Time Delay Neural Network was used for reconstruction and prediction. Comparing with the next six month observations and predictions, all of them are located within the predicted error bars. These results show that neural network methods may be used, within certain limits, for prediction and evaluation of predictability of time series measured from phenomena influenced by complex climatic and geophysical processes, like SST

   83:   of 8,000 detected lightning flashes were positive. The current average intensity of this lightning is 18 kA being concentrated at Serra da Canastra. A meteorologic analysis identified a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS), with not small intensity wind shear, 3m/s/km. This storm presented high density about 0,3 flashes./Km2/h. However none of the existent theories was sufficient to explain this is event. This study proposes a new theory, where the positive lightning were originate from small center of cloud charges

   83:  Lightning is a transient, high-current electric discharge whose path is measured in kilometers. On Earth the principal sources of lightning are the thunderstorm clouds (cumulonimbus). Thus a simple theoretical model for the stepped leader path in the earth's atmosphere was developed, based upon the assumption that the leader path follows the maximum gradient of the electric potential, and taking into account the gradient of the atmospheric conductivity, the charge deposited along the leader channel and the charge at the leader tip. The model is compared with the constant conductivity model reported by Takagi et al. (1986). The comparison indicates that the inclusion of the gradient of the atmospheric conductivity allows positive flashes to occur even in the case of no horizontal displacement between the positive and the negative charges inside the cloud. Also, the model result indicates that the inclusion of a constant charge density along the leader channel can change considerably the strike point on the ground

   83:  The aboveground biomass content of a region can be estimated by either direct or indirect methods. Direct methods correspond to the biomass content determination with scales and extrapolation of results to larger areas. It is a destructive and very laborious procedure. Indirect methods utilize formulas whose entrance parameters are obtained from forest inventories. Forest inventories are made with the purpose to plan exploration and land use and the inventory data are frequently not suitable for biomass estimation. Problems with both methods increase in the Amazon region, where little information is available on forest biomass. The objective of this paper is to establish, by comparing the application of the indirect and direct methods in the determination of the biomass, the more appropriate indirect formulation to represent the characteristic vegetation of a region in the amazonian forest. A 0.2 hectare area was chosen, which was part of a major forest clearing experiment conducted in Tome Acu, a town located 250 Km south of Belem, the capital of the Brazilian state of Para. The entire biomass in the area was weighted with scales during the three weeks that followed the cut of the forest in July 1994. A detailed inventory was carried out in the area and then the indirect method was applied in the data. Seven different formulas for determining biomass were used. Comparison of the data of real mass and the mass obtained through the application of the seven formulas indicated that the more suitable for the region is given by FW =       , where FW is total fresh weight  (kg),  is the diameter at breast height (cm), H is the total height of the tree and   ,    and    are regression coefficients (equal to 0.026, 1.529 and 1,747, respectively)

   83:  The trajectories of air parcels and the dispersion of contaminants originating in Alta Floresta-MT (09 52'S, 56 06 W, 288 m), during the dry burning season in this alluvial gold-mining region, which injects mercury in the atmosphere,  are determined through a semi-lagrangian numerical scheme, following an isentropic surface. Data from the Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment in Alta Floresta-ECLAF, carried out from August, 15 to 30, 1995, together with NMC analises for the region, were used. The region was under the influence of an anti-cyclone, that inhibited the convenction, except on days 28 and 29, when an instability in the east occured. The dominant direction of the wind, up to 500 m, was from the S-SE quadrant, with an average value of 4 m/s at 250 m. The trajectories at the beginning of the period were directed towards NW, reaching Rondonia in four days, thus demonstrating that the air may carry mercury to non-mining areas during the calm dry burning season

   83:  An analytical theory for the highly unsteady, strongly nonlinear, geometrically complex problem of stability of optimal three-dimensional, non-thrusting, single-pass skip maneuvers is introduced. Under Eggers's classical hypothesis, and assuming a shallow entry, we start out by solving a final-speed maximization problem. This yields explicit optimal control laws. The resulting trajectory is then adopted as a reference to which regular perturbations are applied, with the corresponding equations being subsequently nondimensionalized. Analysis of the system thus obtained reveals that existence of a new mode typical of hypersonic, high-altitude flight can be expected. Stability of this mode is assessed and a set of accurate analytic solutions for three-dimensional skips is presented

   83:  Ever since Gazley, Allen  Eggers, and Chapman effectively founded the Dynamic Theory of Planetary Entry, in the late 1950's, and Etkin inaugurated the application of Stability Theory to hypersonic flight (1961), analytical solutions have, for the most part, been recorded in the published literature only for highly restrictive cases of planar entry. The difficult case of three-dimensional (3-D) maneuvers has been approached in a numerical fashion only - or left untouched altogether. Yet, these pose, perhaps, the most challenging problems in the whole of hypervelocity flight  mechanics, as the highly unsteady, strongly nonlinear characteristics of planar entry become, in the 3-D case, greatly compounded by the very geometry of the maneuver

   87:  CAPTURA GRAVITACIONAL
   83:  The gravitational capture is a very interesting phenomenon that allows a spacecraft that is in a hyperbolic orbit around a celestial body to be transferrede to an elliptic orbit without the use of any propulsive system. One of the objectives of this paper is to study the problem of gravitational capture in the restricted three-body problem. We study the importance of several of the parameters involved for a capture in the Earth-Moon system, with emphasis in the time required for the capture. To make this study, a large number of trajectories starting close to the secondary body are numerically integrated backward in time. The initial position and velocity of the spacecraft are changed and it is verified if an escape occurs for every trajectory. From the results it is possible to study the balance between the time required for the capture and the   saved for each maneuver. The existence of "windows" with short time for capture, that are very sharp for values of C3 close to the minimum (  - 0.2) are found. The second part of this paper has the goal of developing a set of analytical equations based in the third body perturbation, using the Planetary equations. It is shown that the gravitational capture does not exist in models using average techniques, what confirms the temporary character of this phenomenon

The goal is to simulate a large variety of initial conditions for these orbits and classify them according to the effects caused by the close approach in the orbit of the spacecraft. The well-known planar restricted circular three-body problem is used as the mathematical model. The equations are regularized (using Lamaitre's regularization), so it is possible to avoid the numerical problems that come from the close approach with the Moon

In the present paper the swing-by maneuvers are studied and classified under the model given by the three-dimensional restricted three-body problem. Several simulations are made to show the effects of the third dimension in this maneuver. To show the results, the orbit of the spacecraft is classified in four groups: elliptic direct, elliptic retrograde. Then, the modification in the orbit of the spacecraft due to the close approach is shown in plots that specify from which group of orbits the spacecraft is coming and to which group it is going. Several families of orbits are found and shown in details

   83:  Space maneuvers using gravitational capture has a large potential of use in the near future. The fuel consumption, in a transfer maneuver using this tecnique, can be smaller than the one required by the Hohmann transfer. In this paper we develop a numerical algorithm to study the problem of gravitational capture in the elliptical restricted three-body problem. The effect of the true anomaly for a fixed eccentricity and the effect of the eccentricity for a fixed true anomaly are studied. We show the numerical results and we conclude that the savings increase with the eccentricity and when the true anomaly goes close to zero, as expected. The contribution of this paper is to show the quantitative results of those savings

This work focuses on a region of about 600 km2 within 40 km range from the Bauru radar, providing the evolution of the mean absolute error of the corresponding areal rainfall when the sampling interval is varied during a period of 30 minutes. A heavy rainfall event descloped mosthy wi thin the area of interest during that period, which was characterized by strong time gradients, typical of this epoch of the year - peak summer. Results have shown errors of about 70

   83:  The objectives of the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study (ABRACOS) were to monitor Amazonian climate and improve the understanding of the consequences of deforestation, and to provide data for the calibration and validation of GCMs and GCM sub-models of Amazonian forest and post-deforestation pasture. Three areas were instrumented (Manaus, AM; Ji-Parana, RO; Maraba, PA), each with different soils, dry season intensities and deforestation densities (Gash et al, 1996). In each area an automatic weather station and soil moisture measurement equipment were installed, both in a primary forest site, and in nearby cattle pasture, for monitoring climate and soil status throughout the year. Additional intensive periods of study (or missions), of varying duration, were operated at these sites: for calibration purposes, to understand the physical processes relevant to each site and for detailed comparisons between sites. In this work, the presentation of the structure of the public data bank with the quality controlled main results of the ABRACOS Project, between September 1990 and August, 1994, is made. The data are divided in six parts, available via Internet (FTP), or in diskettes: Automatic Weather Stations, Micrometeorology, Plant Physiology, Carbon Dioxide Fluxes, Soil Moisture abd Forest Rain Interception

   83:  Since 1995 January in the CPTEC has been made climate simulations every month with the atmospheric global model. The results are for a 6-month period starting from the 4 initial conditions (IC), persisting the last monthly observed sea surface temperature, and produce diary global grid point with intervals of 1.875 degrees in both latitude and longitude, with 19 variables in binary format. A graphic system was developed to visualize mensal and five days mean made with these binary global grids. This system, developed with the GrADS/COLA (Doty, 1995) software is a graphic  interface to permit visualize meteorological variables in graphic form (isolines, shaded) into maps. The objective of this work is present this graphic system, which today is running in CPTEC to visualize the climate predictions, and divulge to public for the use in regional centers and others meteorological institutes. Some facilities of this system are, besides, the calculus of the seasonal means for some areas of global and times series (variable x time) of the model's predictions generated from the each IC

   83:  Numerical weather prediction models simulate the state of the atmosphere by solving equations for the evaluation of various variables such as humidity, wind, pressure, and temperature. The output of the models is defined on a grid. To facilitate the interpretation of this results, a user-friendly graphical interface was developed, based on the GrADS/COLA software. This software was chosen for the following characteristics: its simplicity of commands, its being in the public domain, its well adaptedness to meteorological data, its ability to manipulate windows and buttons with the option of producing animation and the ability to record a sequence of commands in graphic form. The development of this work has as its objective to present a graphic system that can be used by users of the regional model ETA currenty in pre-operational use at CPTEC/INPE

   83:  A two-layer global statistical-dynamical primitive equations model, coupled to a simplified vegetation parametrization, based on Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS), is used to simulate tropical anthropogenic deforestation. The fraction of the earth's surface covered by each BATS vegetation type is obtaining for each latitude belt, to simulate the mean annual zonnaly averaged climate (control experiment). In the Amazonian deforestation experiment the tropical forest is replaced by short grass in South America belt from 10 N to 10 S. The results show an increase both in the surface temperature and in the sensible heat flux to the atmosphere; the latent heat flux decreases. These results are in agreement with those earlier experiments carried out with sophisticated general circulation models

   83:  The upper tropospheric levels cyclonic vortex (VCANs) are weather systems of synoptic scale wich for years call attention of meteorologists. There are several synoptic features involving the persistence of this type of weather disturbances which are not well understood yet. This paper presents a study case of a VCAN over souther Brazil during the period of 03-05 March, 1987. The analysis were done using the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) gridded data. The results shows that this systems was responsible for the occurrence of surface cyclogenesis over South America, and that southward moisture flux played a key role for enhancing instability in that region. Also, the VCAN was associated with a direct thermal circulation

The analysis for the 3-5 March, 1987 period were done using the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecastings (ECMWF) data. The results show that the eastward displacement of the vortex was associated with significant vertical changes of the dynamic tropopause (TD) and the intrusion of stratospheric air in the troposphere. Also, the ocorrence of surface cyclogenese was acomplished by a lowering TD

   83:  The Convective Stratiform Technique (CST), calibrated for Brazil, was implemented at INPE-Cachoeira Paulista, SP to provide rainfall maps in near-real time through Internet. This system could be easily acessed by traditional file transfer protocol (ftp) or home page and it allows the monitoring of rainfall over different regions of Brazil. Therefore, this information could be useful for a large number of users around the country. The CST uses full resolution infrared images from the meteorological satellite GOES-8. The algoritm localizes and estimates rainfall areas and rates for each image using a discrimination equation to filter non precipitating rain from cirrus clouds. Rainfall maps in satellite projection are created for five brazilian geopolitical regions and then converted into another geographical coordinate maps. This procedure is necessary for visualizing the data in a simple framework. The operational system will be soon upgraded to display geopolitical maps of many urban areas in Sao Paulo state. Also, an on-line warning scheme will be implemented to enhance locations with severe storms around the country. Considerations about advantages and disadvantages of this system are also presented in this paper

   83:  Surface radiation balance is derived from Meteosat-5 infrared (IR) measurements in the atmospheric window region (10,5-12,5  m) and visible reflectance chanel (0,4-1,1  m). The images are of NE region for site of Sao Goncalo (Pb) for period of the EIS experiment. The global solar radiation and surface albedo are derived using a dear-sky radiative-transfer model, that considering a Rayleigh atmosphere and absortion due to water-vapor lines. The land surface temperature is derived by Schmetz method. An efficient radiative transference radiative scheme (Lowtran-7) is used to calculate the atmospheric correction to be added to the equivalent black-body temperature at the satellite level to yield the actual surface temperature. The atmospheric correction scheme consider the absortion due to water-vapour lines and the water-vapour continuum, using vertical temperature sounding. The atmospheric radiation is derived by a empirical formulation, that dependies of the air temperature and water-vapor pressure. The results are compared with measurements of the global solar radiation, surface albedo and net radiation. The metods is applied to native vegetation and it presents realistic estimates of the surface radiation balance

   83:  The so-called Dipole Pattern is characterized by a north-south interhemispheric gradient in sea surface temperature (SST), due this mode involves spatially coherent SST variations with opposite sign in each hemisphere, between about 5N-25N and 5S-25S, over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The anomalous SST patterns associated with Atlantic Dipole significantly affect the position and intensity of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and thus exert a considerable influence on the regional climate and rainfall of any continental regions localized in the Americas and Africa (e.g., Northeast Brazil, Sahel and Ghana). In this work is used the composites analyses to investigate the spatial variability of the atmospheric and oceanic characteristics (and its possible relationship) associated with Atlantic Dipole events. The events was selected by temporal series of the SST standardized indices calculated for north and south Atlantic Basins (methodologies report in Servain, 1991)

   83:  A non-linear, three-dimensional primitive equation model is employed to study the effect of coastal upwelling on sea-breeze circulation in the region of Cabo Frio (RJ). In order to investigate the seasonal variations of the circulation, numerical experiments considering three-month means were conducted: January-February-March (JFM), April-May-June (AMJ), July-August-September (JAS) and October-November-December (OND). The results show that the sea-breeze is most intense near the coast in all the seasons. The circulation is stronger in OND and JFM, when the upwelling occurs, and weaker in AMJ and JAS, when there is no upwelling. Observations show similar behaviour

   83:  A diagnostic study of intense precipitations that occurred on the days 07th, 08th, 09th and 10th of April, 1996, in the State of Bahia. Satellite imagery, daily precipitation and analysis of CPTEC data were used in this study. Objective analysis tecniques were utilized to obtain various meteorological fields at standard pressure levels (1000, 850, 500 and 200 hPa). Throughout that four day period, the presence of a cold front and ITCZ were observed in the eastern sector of the Northeast of Brazil unsetting almost all the region with occurence of heavy rainfalls. Moisture convergence and cold air advection in the lower troposphere were seen in association with the systems

   83:  The Regional Atmospheric Modelling System, was used as a tool to study simulations, which the main aim was to verify the influence of a presence of non homogeneus vegetation with different surface and physical characteristics, on local convective system formation analizing theta and the vertical wind component. Intervening his profile, were found typical local circulations formations, as breeze. Such disturb occurs due the thermic and accumulative  forcing, influencing by difference of sensible heat. It also must be observed that the impact of the horizontal vegetation heterogeinity should result on a diurnal evolution of boundary layer

   83:  The development of the mesoscale circulations in Ji-Parana, Rondonia, Brazil, was simulated with the model RAMS. The August 18, 1994 file of NMC was used to initialize the atmospheric fields at the beginning of the simulation, and the synoptic trend was taken into account through a nudging band in the boundary conditions. All the 90 horizontal grids points, separated of 36 km in both x and y directions, of the numerical domain, were considered as covered by tropical forest. The simulated fluxes were compared with the observed fluxes measured during the RBLE3 field campaign of August/94. The results show that the agreement between measured and simulated fluxes is satisfactory; the deviation observed may be due surface parameterization or the boundary conditions considered. This simulation is the initial step to more complex numerical simulations in which detailed vegetation and soil classifications will be included in a nested grid on the region. The results of these simulations will be used in the determination of the strategy in the data collection during LBA experiment

   83:  On our days, the numerical atmospheric limited area models are important tools for medium range weather prediction. Besides, those models are capable of detailing, both in space and time, the structure of meso and small scale meteorological systems occurring in the atmosphere. The use of this type of model allows one to make studies on environmental impacts upon the atmospheric behavior even before any change takes place. The quality of the modeling results obtained is a response of the model being used. The detailing of the results may be assumed computer dependent as the simulation time increases exponentially with the grid point number. The better the model and computer facilities, the better and faster results can be obtained. This paper is intended to show some results obtained from the comparison between RAMS (Colorado State University limited area model) and ARPS (University of Oklahoma limited area model) performances. On the overall, both models are similar. Slight differences between them may be found on grid refining, map projection, cloud microphysics, surface parameterization among others. Simulation performance and results obtained with both models are compared

   83:  The so called "Castanhao", an artificial lake of approximately 50 km by 9 km area for storage of water in the semiarid region of the Ceara state at northeast region of Brazil (NEB) is planned to be concluded by the end of 1999. This paper is intended to through light on the effects of the lake on possible microclimate changes in the region. Upstream from its dam, the lake will cover all the area bellow 100m of altitude, and its center will be located approximately at 5 37'12"S and 38 36'16"W. The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) is used to simulate the atmospheric conditions over that region with and without the lake. Different from the simulation with no lake, the simulation with the lake showed an increase of precipitation on its western side. This increase in precipitation at that position seems to happen due to advection effects coupled with lake effects

   83:  The so called Experimento Integrado do SIGTEC (EIS) is composed of a set of field experiments of one to two weeks duration, held at the semi-arid region of Northeast of Brazil. EIS was designed to make possible the gathering of almost non existing atmospheric data for that region and is intended to make possible the study of its atmospheric behavior. The Experimento de Mesoescala na Atmosfera do sertao first phase (EMAS-I) is the most important field experiment of EIS. It was planned to allow the collection of atmospheric profile data during the wet season of 1994. EMAS-I data would help to tune regional atmospheric models for the Northeast region of Brazil, and to analyze the mesoscale atmospheric systems occurring over that region. EMAS-I started at march 24 and lasted for 13 days. During that Champaign, radiossond, pilot balloon and tethered balloon were used. The tethered balloon was located in Sao Goncalo (Pb). The radiossond stations were located at Fortaleza (Ce), Barbalha (Ce) and Campina Grande (Pb). The pilot balloons were released at Patos (Pb) and Jaguaribe (Ce). This paper describes the field logistics and the execution performance of EMAS-I. EMAS-I was assumed to be a very low cost experiment and the results obtained enhances the desire for needed new field experiments

The first site is Sao Jose dos Campos on the Valley floor, and the second is Sao Benedito on the valley flanks, some 70 Km away. Industrial activity is going on in the cities of the valley floor while incipient agriculture and tourism occur on the valley flanks. Interestingly the rain chemistry of both sites differs little, indicating pollutant transport from industrial to rural zones and supporting the convective atmospheric circulation model proposed for the valley

   83:  The statistical parameters normally used for the evaluation of the NWP models are the anomaly correlation coefficient and the standard error of the predicted field relative to the analysed fields. It's attempted here to evaluate the CPTEC/COLA model using the statistics mentioned above for a case of cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean east of the southern Brazil. The meteorological variables employed are the diagnostic fields vorticity advection, thermal advection, convergence of humidity and the vector Q. The performance of the model in terms of the derived fields is different from that in terms of simple model variables such as the geopotential and the wind components. Of all the important fields the convergence of humidity has the least reliability

   83:  Atmospheric blocking in the Southern Hemisphere is studied using 14 years (1980-1993) of daily data. Results confirmed the three regions of blocking in winter, viz Pacific ocean near New Zealand, Indian and Atlantic oceans. A new region of blocking is found in the Southeast Pacific ocean. All the preferred regions of blocking show large interannual variations. The interannual variations are large in the New Zealand region. It is found that during the La Nina years, the blocking frequency in the New Zealand region is more than double that in El Nino years. The possible causes for this behavior are explored. It is found that the Jet split over New Zealand region is better defined and strong during the La Nina years than in El Nino years. It is know that the jet splitis favorable for formation of blocking highs. This explains why blocking frequency is higher the La Nina years than in El Nino years

   83:  Recent measurements have shown that secondary inversion layers are common features in the middle latitude mesosphere. They occur mainly in the 55-90 Km range and are more frequent during summer and winter. Since 1993, a Rayleigh lidar has been used to measure the density and temperature profiles from 30 to 75Km in Sao Jose dos Campos, SP (23 S, 45 W). The analysis of 106 nights of data, from 1993 to 1995, shows  that the temperatures are systematically lower in the stratosphere and higher in the mesosphere, as compared with the CIRA-86 model. Daily measurements were carried out during the 1995 winter to study the variability  of the profile. In 21 nights of measurements we observed 9 with temperature inversion between 55 and 70 Km. The persistence of the inversion layers was not observed in two consecutive days, indicating a time scale of less  than 24 hours for these structures

   83:  In this paper we have investigated the existence or not, of persistent and significant oscillations in the energy parameters in tropical South America. The kinetic energy equations of divergent (K  ) and rotational (K  ) motion are derived. All the terms of these equations are calculated on each day for five summers (november-february 1985-1990), using NMC wind analysis. Results of the power spectrum analysis indicate several statistically significant peaks and were confirmed with a fourth-order Butterworth  filter. A well defined mode, with a 30 days period, was better detected in the term              , likely associated with 30-60 days Oscillation. The significance of these relationships suggests the potential usefulness of the results obtained for weather and climate prediction in tropical South America

   83:  In this work we study the turbulent signal measured above and below the Amazon Rain Forest (GTE-ABLE-2B Experiment) during daytime, in a dry day, in stable conditions, using wavelet transforms. Here there has been a systematic preoccupation with the scale optimization of the analysis. Such methodology results in better analysis results and can indicate important physical aspects of the turbulent exchange processes. In this we compare the data from above and below the canopy, with the objective of better understanding the role of the Rain Forest's canopy as physical barrier to the exchange processes of heat and momentum

   83:  The Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment in Alta Floresta, MT (09 52'S; 56 06'W; 288 m) - ECLAF, was carried out during the dry and burning season, from August 15 to 30, 1995, as part of an integrated study of mercury dispersion in the atmosphere. It consisted of five dayly radiosoundings, intercalated with rawing soundings, plus surface meteorological observations. For the meteorological analysis, satellite images and synoptic maps were also used. The region was under the influence of an anti-cyclone, with convection inhibition, except on days 28 and 29, when an instability in the East occured. At the surface, the temperature varied from 16 to 37 C, with maxima equal to 34.6  1.4 C, and minima equal to 18.3  1.5 C. The wind, at 10 m, predominated from the S-E quadrant, with a maximum of 3.5 m/s. The relative humidity ranged from 18 to 100
   83:  , with dayly maxima between 80 and 100
   83:   (average 92  6.5
   83:  ); the minima varied from 18 to 33
   83:   (average 26.2  4.0
   83:  ), occuring between 13 to 15 LST. These results show the occurence, during the day of the dry season, of very low air moisture values in Amazonia

   83:  The influence of climatics factor under the forest is very important in the determination of the climatics impacts caused in the forest as in a major regional scale. One of the natural fenomeno that causes climatic impact in the rainforest regions is the South-Oscillation. The South-Oscillation is a complex fenomeno, what includes in a of it's fases (negative fase) the event named El Nino, in the positive fase the event is named La Nina. One observational study was realized with the objective of investigate the role of this events in the variation of the precipitation under the region, remembering that this meteorological variant is very representative of the climate in the tropical regions. It was realized statistical analisis with the monthly media precipitation at fourthteen stations meteorologicals in the Amazonian forest region. The results this study showed that there is a tendency for occurence of a precipitation enhancement during the La Nina event and a deficit to the event El Nino to the major studied station

   83:  Extended empirical orthogonal function analysis is used to describe the evolution of large-scale spatial patterns associated with high-frequency synoptic variability over the region of South America. Prior to computing the modes the data are filtered using a band-pass Lanczos filter to retain fluctuations having periods in the range of 2-15 days. The principal modes for sea level pressure are computed for each year during the period 1981-1995. The patterns for other variables, such as 925-hPa u and v wind components, 925-hPa temperature and 500-hPa geopotential height, are obtained by computing the correlations between the principal component time series of a determined sea level pressure mode (time series of the amplitudes) and the time series of filtered anomalies at each grid point for the other variables. The evolution depicted by the first mode contains features commonly observed associated with major cold air outbreaks over South America. These include: a major amplification of the upper-air wave pattern, with an amplifying ridge in the eastern Pacific moving eastward over extreme southern South America; an intensifying surface anticyclone west of Chile, which moves east-southeastward as it approaches the Andes mountains, and then moves north-northeastward toward lower latitudes over the continent; a cold front that advances northward with time reaching the western Amazon Basin; and a strong reversal in the meridional low-level flow from northerly winds to southerly winds as the cold front advances northward over the continent. The evolution described above is most prevalent during the southern winter, and is sometimes associated with frost and freezes in subtropical agricultural areas

   83:  We investigate the surges of polar air that occasionally propagate into southeastern Brazil during winter time and are harmful to coffee production, because of the freezing conditions related to them. The cooling is also felt in southern and with less intensity in the western Amazonia. We study three events of the winter of 1994: 26 June, 9 July and 4 August. These frost events caused a sharp drop in the coffee production and similarly dramatic increases in the world coffee prices. We performe an study of synoptic and climatic aspects of these cold surges episodes by using daily surface climatic observations for the June case study, and an analysis the dynamic aspects of this cold episode and to study the cooling mechanisms by using the 4-times a day surface and upper-air NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, in order to look for possible predictors

   83:  The nightly and seasonal variations in gravity wave activity in the mesopause region are studied by analyzing 71 nights of atmospheric sodium (80 - 105 Km) densities observations obtained by a laser radar during a 8-year period at Sao Jose dos Campos (23 S, 46 W). The data are used to calculate the atmospheric density perturbations and its spectra in temporal frequency [Fa(  ) x  ] and in vertical wavenumber [Fa(  ) x m]. The atmospheric density variances,  spectra magnitudes, and m spectra magnitudes all exhibit considerable nightly variability and a weak annual and semiannual variations. The rms atmospheric density perturbations has an annual mean value of 6.85
   83:  . The   and m spectra exhibit power law shapes with slopes varying, respectively, between -1.02 and -2.04, and between -1.39 and -3.93. The annual mean slopes are -1.34 [Fa(  ) and -2.42 [Fa(m)]

   83:  Characteristics of meteorological fields for El Nino (1987) and La Nina (1988) years are examined. These fields show some of the well known characteristics associated with ENSO and are consistent with the observed precipitation. In this paper the vertically integrated water vapour transport and its divergence are calculated for these two years. The data set used is the reanalysis of National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The differences in the transport of water vapour are directly connected to differences in precipitation. In a large part of South America the precipitation is higher in 88/89 than in 86/87. In the Asian monsoon region also precipitation is higher in June, July, August and September (JJAS) of 1988 than in JJAS of 1987. The difference in divergence of water vapour transport is high in the equatorial Pacific around 180 . In a large part of South America the convergence of water vapour transport is higher in the summer of La Nina year. The transport and convergence are also higher in JJAS of 1988 than in JJAS of 1987

   83:  The analyses of digital infrared satellite data permit an identification of convective activity over the globe. In this paper the daily, seasonal and interannual convective activity variability over South America is analysed using the digital data of satellite images. The data are obtained from Meteosat and Goes of 1993 and 1994. The seasonal variation is very well detected, coherent with the observed precipitation. Daily charts show activity related to synoptic systems which affect South America. Five areas of Brazil are analysed with the daily data: north, northeast, south, southeast and central west. Time series of the percentage of values over 120 inside each area indicate the main periods affected by convective activity and time series of anomalies permit the identification of extreme convection. Interannual differences can be analysed, mainly in regions where precipitation anomalies occurred

   83:  The ultra-long waves of the main meteorological fields (geopotential, velocity, temperature, ozone) play a very important role in the formation of weather and climate regimes of the atmospheric circulation. There is a obvious correlation between the events of the blocking formation and the values of the amplitude of the first mode of geopotential. In this work we have investigated the relationship between the vortex formation in the Eastern Pacific and a blocking episode during 19/12-26/12/1996 near 180W. We have found that this blocking is associated with large amplitude of the wave with zonal number 4, and the formation the vortex is associated with this blocking. Arriving South America and interacting with the South Convergence Zone (SACZ) this vortex is converting into blocking vortex pair over South of Brazil. Very strong precipitation was generated over Southern Brazil at that time. In order to determine the role the baroclinic instability for the increasing of ultra-long waves we have used geostrophic equation type II and investigated stability of zonal flow in more common nonlinear formulation. We found that the growing of the amplitude of planetary waves in our case was not associated with this type of instability

The calculation are performed for summer, winter and annual periods and over the following regions: Northern and Southern Hemisphere (HN, HS), Tropics (RT) and South America and adjoining oceans (AS).

   83:  Cluster analysis was performed for Goes 8 images, defining 8 cloud cover types over the South American tropical belt, May 1996 at 1500 GMT. The resulting class distributions were compared with precipitation pattern forecasts from CPTEC/COLA GCM. Considering the spatial resolution and the data input for model, precipitation areas forecast satisfactorily fits to actually observed convective complexes and stratiform systems locations. This is not always the case for complexes in a smaller time and space scale, not forecast by the model

   83:  The non-parametric test of Mann-Kendall is used to determine whether there is , or not, an statistically significant trend in the series and as an indication of the general direction of the change. The Mann-Kendall statistic demands statistical independence of the series. Since the year-to-year correlation of sreamflow in a given year with the same streamflow of the previous or subsequent year is usually quite low, the test has been widely applied in climatic and hydrologic data. However, it has been found that for regions with large basin-memory such as the Amazon basin or Pantanal, or under intense use of water for irrigation or electricity generation such as the Sao Francisco River basin, this test may be misleading due to a large serial autocorrelation of river data

   83:  The swing-by maneuver uses a dose approach with a celestial body to modify the velocity, energy, and angular momentum of a spacecraft. The literature has several papers studying this problem, usually using a patched-conic approximation. In the present paper the swing-by maneuvers are studied and classified under the model given by the three-dimensional restricted three-body problem. To show the results, the orbits of the spacecraft are classified in four groups: elliptic direct, elliptic retrograde, hyperbolic direct, and hyperbolic retrograde. Then the modification in the orbit of the spacecraft caused by the close approach is shown in plots that specify from which group of orbits the spacecraft is coming and to which group it is going. Several families of orbits are found and shown in detail. The effect of every parameter involved in this problem is studied individually. The results generated here have a potential use to solve optimal problems, such as finding trajectories that satisfy some given constraints (such as achieving an escape or capture) with some parameters being extremized (position, velocity, etc.). Two optimal problems are solved in this paper to show this application

   83:  Observations from the ABRACOS experiment are used to study the spatial extent and intensity of the cold surges (friagem) of 26 June 1994. This has been characterized as very strong and has produced freezing conditions and extensive damage to the coffee grown in southeastern Brazil. Minimum temperatures in southern Amazonia (Ji-Parana) dropped almost 15 C in less than 24 hours. Central and in less degree western Amazonia (Manaus and Maraba sites, respectively), also show the temperature and moisture decreasing during the days with friagem. Based on our analysis, it seems that atmospheric conditions in Manaus and Maraba were favorable for radiative cooling, while in Ji-Parana and in southeastern Brazil the occurrence of minima temperatures with clear skies and strong winds is an indication of strong advection of cold air from the south

   83:  Climate modification caused by human influency such as deforestation, reforestation, urbanization, etc, may have significant impact local and global climate. In particular, on tropical forest regions, like Amazon forest, the indiscriminate deforest may have major impact on climate, causing precipitation, evapotranspiration and of the air temperature variations in the region. A primitive equation Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) (Franchito e Rao, 1992) is used to conduct experiments related to climate modification due to human activity (deforestation). This paper the model is hemispheric (only the southern hemisphere is consider), and includes parametrization of diurn cycle solar radiation. The results of the modelling study showing that in all months of the year, when the tropical forest is replacing by grassland, there is a decrease in the surface net radiation (due to the increase of the surface albedo and, consequently, reduction in the solar radiation absorved by grassland), a decrease in the precipitation and the ascending motion of the Hadley cell. It was also noted that there is an increase in the surface temperature indicating that the heating effect due decrease on evapotranspiratio overcomes the effect of the surface albedo increase. The results obtained with this simple model agree qualitatively with those from General Circulation Models, showing the usefulness of this kind of model in studies of climate change, particulary in the determination of the relationship of "cause-effect"

The control available to perform this task is a sequence of two or three impulses. The main goal is to study what is the best approach for a large set of initial and final orbits. Two methods available in the literature (one for a two-impulse and one for a three-impulse maneuver) are selected and used for comparison. The results show the fuel consumption for each case and produces a map of the regions of optimality for both cases

   83:  In this work we consider the problem of two-impulse orbital transfer between coplanar elliptical orbits with minimum fuel consumption but with a time limit for this transfer. This time limit imposes a new characteristics to the problem that rules out the majority of transfer. This time limit imposes a new characteristic to the problem that rules out the majority of transfer methods. Then we used the equations presented by D. F. Lawden, modified and solved those equations to develop a software for orbital maneuvers. This software will be used in the next missions developed by INPE. The original method developed by Lawden considers only the case where the points of beginning and the end of maneuver are known. The software developed here extends this method to the case where only one point is known and to the case where the two points are free. The four possible cases were tested with success

   83:  In this paper the interaction between the attitude control system and the flexible structure of an artificial satellite during orbit transfer maneuver has been investigated. The satellite was modeled by a rigid central body with one or more flexible appendages. The dynamics equations were obtained by Lagragean approach. The flexible appendages were treated as clamped-free beam and its displacement was discretized by assumed-mode method. In order to transfer the satellite, a typical Hohmann transfer and a burn-coast-burn strategy were used and the attitude was controlled by an on-off controller. During transfer procedure a global analysis of satellite has been done, such as: performance of control system, influence of elastic response in control system, thruster firing frequency, fuel consumption and variation of orbital elements. In order to avoid the interaction with structure motion, a control system with bandwidth of one decade bellow the fundamental frequency was used. In the simulations the firing frequency of the structure. The control system has kept the attitude below the specifications. As a result, the orbit transfer maneuvering has been done correctly without excessive excitation of flexible appendage

   83:  In this paper some aspects of the French-Brazilian Micro-Satellite attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) are presented. Basically, the mission is divided in two phases. In the first one, called aerobraking phase, the AOCS is responsible for the reduction of the orbit. In the second one, called routine phase, the satellite must be pointing to the sun. The AOCS performance is evaluated when the satellite is subjected to environment perturbation torques during the routine phase mode. The requirements of pointing necessary to perform the experiments of the French-Brazilian scientific mission are satisfied

   83:  Este trabalho analisa teoricamente uma ou mais configuracoes de suspensoes eletricas as quais poderao ser usadas para o desenvolvimento de microssensores e microatuadores. A motivacao para este trabalho surgiu da observacao das tendencias mundiais no desenvolvimento de subsistemas cada vez menores e cada vez mais precisos para satelites cada vez mais compactos (micro e nanossatelites). O trabalho faz uma analise teorica  compreendendo: 1) o estudo da estabilidade da suspensao eletrica; 2) o estudo das propriedades eletricas e mecanicas de uma suspensao do tipo citado e na 3) exploracao de suas caracteristicas Parte-se do 4) modelamento de todas as forcas e torques atuantes numa suspensao e as suas influencias na dinamica de um rotor, um caso de estudo 5) Particulariza-se esse resultado para uma solucao nova que apresenta diversas vantagens para o desenvolvimento de sensores inerciais 6) Entao, pela primeira vez, estuda-se mais em detalhes essa ultima configuracao e analisa-se uma aplicacao ao caso de um sensor de velocidade angular em malha fechada. Essa analise do comportamento dinamico desse rotor suspenso e feita em malha aberta, primeiramente, e entao malha fechada. Verifica-se o seu comportamento apos os transitorios e a resposta a degrau unitario e semelhante a que se obteria com sensores convencionais disponiveis no mercado. Faz-se um estudo comparativo mostrando essas semelhancas em termos de funcoes de transferencia. Apresentam-se simulacoes numericas de uma suspensao para uma placa rigida e nao girante. Finalmente mostra-s um primeiro experimento de laboratorio que procurou comprovar a viabilidade da suspensao eletrica utilizando-se equipamentos e materiais padrao de laboratorio

   83:  Neste traballho investiga-se a utilizacao de redes neurais em controle de atitude de satelites artificiais. Com a intencao de validar esta aplicacao, optou-se por um satelite constituido por um corpo rigido central, do qual pendem apendices articulados que sao considerados flexiveis apos o desdobramento. A dinamica assim gerada tem o carater nao-linear tipico para utilizacao de redes neurais. As equacoes do movimento para geracao dos dados de treinamento e teste das redes sao obtidas pelo metodo da Funcao Lagrangeana, adotando-se um processo de discretizacao para o movimento elastico. Para validar o controle de atitude, e utilizado como exemplo a geometria de um satelite similar ao satelite de sensoriamento remoto da Missao Espacial Completa Brasileira (MECB) durante a manobra de apontamento fino da atitude, apos a fase de abertura dos paineis, assim como tambem em situacoes onde considera-se a presenca de torques perturbadores externos e incertezas nas propriedades de massa do veiculo. O treinamento das redes neurais e feito com um algoritmo de Filtragem de Kalman com processamento local. Emprega-se um controlador com a estrutura do tipo "Internal Model Control" (IMC). ABSTRACT: This work evaluates the use of artificial neural networks for satellite attitude dynamics identification and control. In order to exemplify this application, a satellite with a rigid main body, three reaction wheel and three flexible solar panels is chosen (lay-out similar to Brazilian Remote Sensing Satellite). The differential equations therefore show the nonlinear dynamic effects to be identified by neural nets. The equations of motion used to generate training and testing data are derived by the Lagrangian approach for quasi-coordinates (rotational motion) and for generalized coordinates (elastic motion). To validate the attitude control the      situation of fine pointing, with open solar panels is considered in the presence of perturbing torques and errors in the satellite moments of inertia. The identification     of neural nets parameters is performed by a Kahnan filtering algorithm local parallel processing and control structure used is that of the Internal Model Control (IMC)

   83:  As distribuicoes do tipo fase (distribuicoes PH) permitem aproximar tao bem quanto se queira qualquer distribuicao de probabilidade continua positiva. Devido as suas caracteristicas, essas distribuicoes podem ser facilmente utilizadas em modelos markovianos de decisao desde que suas fases sejam observaveis. Mas no caso de fases nao observaveis, nao se tem disponivel na literatura nenhuma solucao para o problema da insercao de distribuicoes PH em Processos Markovianos de Decisao a Tempo Continuo. O objetivo deste trabalho e apresentar uma solucao para esta questao em aberto. Para isto propoe-se uma metodologia utilizando a teoria dos Processos Markovianos de Decisao com Informacao Parcial. Resultados numericos sao apresentados onde aplica-se a metodologia proposta na otimizacao de um modelo de manutencao cujos tempos de reparo nao sao exponenciais e na otimizacao do controle de uma fila PH/PH/1/N

Estamos assumindo neste estudo, que a frenagem da rotacao deve acontecer antes da separacao do satelite, ou seja, apos o fim de queima do quarto estagio do VLS, tendo em vista nao ser possivel a utilizacao de um sistema 'yo-yo' no satelite. Devido a atual configuracao do VLS nao prever nenhum sistema de frenagem de rotacao, inclusive via 'yo-yo', e tambem ao fato que o prototipo VLS-02 ja esta em andamento, o calculo foi realizado para quatro situacoes possiveis para localizacao do sistema. A escolha final do posicionamento devera ficar a cargo da equipe do lancador

   83:  Este relatorio de atividades cobre o periodo entre 1o. de fevereiro e 31 de julho de 1998. A escolha desta data limite para a definicao do periodo foi determinada pela preocupacao em elaborar uma descricao pormenorizada de um trabalho consolidado. O relatorio descreve as fases finais do trabalho realizado no desenvolvimento do sistema de pre-ionizacao do ETE (Experimento Tokamak Esferico), que esta em construcao no Laboratorio Associado de Plasma do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (LAP - INPE), e os esforcos empreendidos para a caracterizacao experimental e teorica de uma cavidade toroidal com razao de aspecto igual a 1,25. E bom lembrar que o sistema de pre-ionizacao por ressonancia eletron-ciclotronica a ser implantado e essencial para o funcionamento do ETE ja na sua fase inicial [1] [2]. Por outro lado, a caracterizacao da cavidade toroidal representa o primeiro passo dentro de um programa mais amplo, destinado a investigar um novo esquema de aquecimento do plasma por RF no ETE [3] [4]. Deste modo, os projetos sao complementares, embora tenham tempos de realizacao diferentes. O primeiro e de curto prazo e o segundo de medio e longo prazos. Procurando garantir autonomia ao texto e maior clareza na compreensao das tarefas executadas, o relatorio esta estruturado da seguinte maneira: inicialmente, e dado um RESUMO DO PLANO DE PESQUISA e, em seguida, fornecido um RESUMO DO PRIMEIRO RELATORIO. Posteriormente, as ATIVIDADES DESENVOLVIDAS no periodo sao descritas. Uma secao com as PUBLICACOES baseadas nos resultados obtidos foi incluida, bem como uma justificativa para a RENOVACAO DA BOLSA. Um CRONOGRAMA DE ATIVIDADES comparando a proposta inicial de execucao do projeto com aquilo que efetivamente foi realizado complementa a exposicao das atividades desenvolvidas. Nesta mesma secao, e proposto um novo cronograma para o caso da bolsa ser renovada. Ha uma secao destinada as REFERENCIAS bibliograficas e cinco APENDICES dedicados a informacoes complementares

   83:  A variabilidade interanual de campos atmosfericos totais e zonalmente assimetricos e estudada atraves de analises de variancias, padroes de Funcoes Ortogonais Empiricas (EOF) bem como usando mapas de correlacoes entre as series temporais de componentes principais e series de anomalias filtradas de algumas variaveis, para os periodos de DJF e JJA. O periodo de estudo e de 1979 a 1995. A area de estudo abrange todas as longitudes porem e delimitada latitudinalmente pelos paralelos 80 S e 80 N. Analise de variancias (total, interanual e suas razoes) foram feitas para pressao ao nivel do mar (PNM), vento zonal em 200 hPA, altura geopotencial em 500 hPa, radiacao de onda longa (ROL), velocidade vertical em coordenadas de pressao em 500 hPA, e temperatura em 925 hPA, e para altura geopotencial em 500 hPA assimetrico. Estas analises sugerem que a alta variabilidade nos tropicos esta relacionada ao ciclo El Nino-Oscilacao Sul (ENOS). Sazonalidade e evidente em todos os padroes das variancias para todas as variaveis, com a maxima variabilidade nas latitudes medias e altas do hemisferio de inverno, exceto para ROL e velocidade vertical. Para essas duas variaveis a variabilidade e pronunciada nos tropicos e durante o verao do HS. O primeiro modo de PNM mostra um padrao de onda numero um nas regioes tropical e extratropical, que descreve caracteristicas consistentes com os extremos da Oscilacao Sul (OS). Os padroes de correlacao para as outras variaveis mostram diferencas sazonais possivelmente relacionadas a epoca que se estabelecem os estagios ENOS. As caracteristicas mais importantes estao relacionadas ao padrao do tipo trem de ondas encontrado nos campos totais e assimetricos de correlacao da componente zonal do vento em 200 hPa e da altura geopotencial em 500 hPA. Em DJF notam-se, para a componente assimetrica destas variaveis, padroes de trem de ondas na regiao do Atlantico/Africa. Em JJA observa-se um padrao de trem de ondas para o vento zonal assimetrico no Pacifico Sul. Estas caracteristicas nao sao observadas nos correspondentes campos totais. As caracteristicas distintas para os padroes atmosfericos de campos totais e assimetricos do vento zonal em 200 hPa e altura geopotencial em 500 hPa, sugerem que possivelmente a parte assimetrica dessas variaveis desempenha papel importante nas interacoes das circulacoes tropical e extratropical

   83:  Medida de superficie e da Camada Limite Planetaria (CLP) realizadas nas areas de floresta (10 graus 05'S - 10 graus 19'S e 61 graus 57'W) e de pastagem (10 graus 45'S e 62 graus 22'W) na regiao de Ji-Parana, RO, durante o experimento da camada limite de Rondonia (Rondonia Boundary Layer Experiment - RBLE), nas estacoes secas de julho/1993 (RBLE2) e de agosto/1994 (RBLE3), foram utilizadas para analisar a estrutura e evolucao da CLP e tambem para estimar regionalmente os fluxos turbulentos de calores sensivel e latente. Essas estimativas foram comparadas com as medidas dos fluxos de superficie de calores sensivel e latente feitas pelo instrumento de correlacoes de vortices turbulentos (HYDRA). Perfis de temperatura potencial e de umidade especifica foram obtidos por meio de radiossonda e de balao cativo. As medidas feitas por esses equipamentos foram representativas das caracteristicas de cada tipo de cobertura de superficie. Durante o ciclo diurno, a estrutura e evolucao da CLP sobre a area de pastagem foi bem mais significativa que sobre a area de floresta. As taxas de crescimento entre 11 e 14 HL na area de pastagem chegaram a ser 65
   83:   maiores que na area de floresta durante o RBL3, com valores de 351,5 m h  e 229,2 m h  , respectivamente. Series temporais e medias diarias da altura da CLP e das temperatura potencial e umidade especifica foram analisadas para as areas de floresta e de pastagem durante o RBLE2 e RBLE3. As alturas da CLP foram maiores na area de pastagem, alem de que, a camada residual para essas areas manteve-se durante todo o ciclo diurno. As estimativas regionais dos fluxos de calor sensivel e de calor latente foram feitas atraves da inversao de um modelo simples de camada bem misturada, o qual usa os parametros obtidos dos perfis das propriedades da CLP. Dois modelos  simples, baseados nas equacoes de conservacao para a CLP, foram usados para estimar estes fluxos. Um desses modelos incluiu em suas equacoes um termo para estimar a adveccao horizontal. Os resultados mostraram que, para o caso das estimativas dos fluxos de calor sensivel, o modelo sem adveccao tendeu a superestimar os fluxos medidos pelo HYDRA, tanto na area de floresta quanto em area de pastagem. Neste caso, o Desvio Medio Quadratico (DMQ) e o Vies medio global das estimativas do fluxo de calor sensivel, na floresta, foram de 45,1 W m  e  -20 W m  e, para a pastagem, foram de 67,2 W m  e -28,5  W m  . Para o caso dos fluxos de calor latente, o modelo sem adveccao superestimou grosseiramente os fluxos medidos. Ja o modelo que inclui o termo de adveccao simula melhor os valores medidos tanto de calor sensivel (floresta: DMQ 39,5 W m  e Vies -8,5 W m  , pastagem: DMQ 55,0 W m  e Vies, -11,62 W m  ) como de calor latente (floresta: DMQ 64,8 W m  e Vies 5,9 W m  , pastagem: DMQ 137,7 W m  e Vies -29,8 W m  ). Estes resultados sugerem que houve uma diferenca significativa entre as estimativas em escala regional dos fluxos e aqueles medidos em unico ponto. Apesar da simplicidade dos modelos, estes fornecem uma alternativa para estimar fluxos de superficie, conhecidas propriedades da CLP obtidas atraves de radiossonda e de balao cativo

Propoe-se estudar as inter-relacoes do sistema ionosfera-termosfera e caracterizar os processos fisicos causantes dos disturbios neste setor, onde a configuracao do campo geomagnetico apresenta forte variabilidade do angulo de declinacao magnetica e da intensidade do campo. Esperam-se respostas do sistema com algumas dependencias latitudinais. Estuda-se a propagacao dos ventos termosfericos perturbados e as causas das fases negativas em foF2 com dados de ionossonda e com ajuda do modelo FLIP (Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma). Encontra-se que as tempestades desenvolvidas no minimo solar produzem efeitos maiores sobre a ionosfera que aquelas desenvolvidas no maximo solar. Os efeitos sazonais prevalescem sobre os de ciclo solar em altas latitudes. Os padroes modelados de ventos acompanham as mudancas de h max e sao de magnitude maior em medias latitudes. Observa-se claramente a propagacao de perturbacoes nos ventos associada ao inicio de sub-tempestades. Existe uma serie de fatores locais que induzem mudancas na ionosfera durante a propagacao latitudinal e longitudinal dos disturbios: em IRJ predominam as fases negativas, causadas por mudancas na composicao da atmosfera neutra, diminuicoes em [O]/[N2] podem ser de ate 80
   83:  . Sobre CON, as fases negativas nao podem ser completamente explicadas por efeitos de composicao; nesta estacao de medias latitudes a acao dos ventos e mais efetiva e e a que determina o comportamento de h max. Em CP, campos eletricos e ventos zonais tambem influenciam em forma importante h max

   83:  This report describes the application of optimal nonlinear/non-Gaussian filtering to the problem of INS/GPS integration. This approach, is made possible by a new technique called Particle Filtering (PF) which may cope with nonlinear models without any limitation, and non-Gaussian noises as well. The main feature of this Particle Filtering is that it constructs the conditional probability of the variable to be estimated, with respect to the measurements, through a suitable random particle exploration of the state space followed by a Dayes correction of the particles weights. The application of this new filtering method to the problem of tightly coupling GPS receivers to inertial navigation systems has permitted the achievement of very good results, when compared to the traditional methods hitherto used

   83:  Este livro e o resultado da evolucao de notas de aula, de parte da disciplina sobre Metodos Matematicos da Fisica, que o autor ministrou durante varios anos no Curso de Pos-Graduacao do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais. Embora o material tenha sido dirigido a alunos de-pos-graduacao, este livro e autoconsistente o suficiente para ser tambem ministrado, num semestre, a alunos do 3 ano em fisica, em substituicao de materias tais como Calculo Vetorial, Algebra Linear e Analise Tensorial. Em geral, a conteudo desta obra visa facilitar a compreensao e manipulacao da matematica necessariamente encontrada nos campos teoricos da Fisica, especialmente os que envolvem campos vetoriais (Eletrodinamica, Mecanica Classica, Fisica de Plasmas, etc.), espacos lineares (Mecanica Quantica) e campos tensoriais (Teoria da Relatividade, Fisica de Plasmas, Mecanica de Fluidos, etc.). A apresentacao consiste num tratamento nao-ortodoxo, tanto na notacao quanto na abordagem dos temas, com vistas em fazer com que o leitor, com formacao (ou em formacao) em ciencias fisicas, atinja seu objetivo fundamental, que e o de utilizar a Matematica como ferramenta da Fisica. Contudo, apesar de parte do rigor matematico ter sido sacrificado, dando-se mais espaco a uma compreensao objetiva, todas as demonstracoes vem acompanhadas da necessaria justificacao teorica. Sabe-se que para a aprendizagem da Matematica nao e suficiente o conhecimento teorico transmitido, mas e necessario que o leitor tenha habilidade na sua manipulacao; isto somente e possivel com a pratica, resolvendo problemas. Por esta razao, ao final de cada capitulo, sao incluidos problemas destinados a elucidar conceitos e a ajudar o leitor a por em pratica os conhecimentos adquiridos

   83:  We present an evaluation of global-scale equatorial and low latitude ionospheric disturbances in response to the weak-to-moderate disturbed conditions that marked the SUNDIAL/ATLAS1 twelve-day campaign of March 22 to April 2, 1992. Ionosonde data from South American and Indian-Asian longitudes are analyzed to examine first the climatological (the average) pattern of the critical F region parameters (the layer peak density and height) in comparison with the empirical International Reference Ionospheric model, and then to characterize the day-to-day variabilities aiming at identifying potential causal contributions from either disturbance zonal and meridional winds or magnetospheric, and disturbance dynamo electric fields. Included in this analysis are data from South American midlatitude locations which are used to determine meridional winds using an adaptation of the servo analysis technique in the Field Line Integrated Plasma (FLIP) model. We have made an assessment of the causal mechanism of the day-to-day variabilities as arising from latitude dependent disturbance meridional winds, and from electric fields produced by disturbance zonal winds and disturbance dynamo. While the contribution from disturbance meridional winds decreases from middle to equatorial latitudes, that of the electric fields maximizes around the equator. In particular, first-time evidence based on ionosonde data is provided for a disturbance dynamo electric field in the equatorial ionosphere. It is found that there are two time intervals of maximum ionospheric variability resulting from the weak to moderate magnetospheric; disturbance conditions that prevailed during the campaign: one near the evening/postsunset hours and the other in the postmidnight-sunrise hours over low latitudes. At midlatitudes a broad maximum of the response occurs from premidnight to morning hours. We provide a comparison of results for the South American and Indian-Asian longitudes and a discussion of the competing roles of the disturbance zonal and meridional winds, and magnetospheric and disturbance dynamo electric fields as a function of latitude

   83:  An array of 29 vector magnetometers was operated in N-NE Brazil from November 1990 until March 1991, We present the analysis of 16 selected quiet days, for which a simple model of an equivalent current distribution for the Sq and EEJ, fits the observed maximum amplitude of the daily variation at midday. In equatorial regions the precise latitude profile of the Sq field is masked by the EEJ, this uncertainty is resolved by assuming that the EEJ, obtained after substracting the Sq from the daily ranges, should present a ratio of 0.3 for the westaward to easward current. With this constraint, a combined non-linear least squares inversion of Sq and EEJ was used  to estimate the parameters of Onwumechlis's model of the EEJ curent distribution. The H and Zcomponents of the EEJ are jointly inverted and good a, agreement obtained between the calculated and observed data for all 16 days.The EEJ's main parameters averaged for 16 quiet days were: A total positive current intensity equal to 67+/-20 (10-3)A) for diurnal range Mg (or 80+/-20 (10(3) A) for M-3) and a half-width of 403+/-67 Km. The EEJ centre was located at 21+/- 16 Km south of the dip equator. The Sq was estimate from several permanent observatories and found to be mean latitude of 5.5 +/-2 degrees south

Os objetos em uma cena sao identificados e classificados e em seguida, as relacoes entre eles sao interpretadas utilizando suas coordenadas e conhecimento sobre o tipo de cena. No modelo hibrido proposto, duas redes neurais sao utilizadas em sequencia para efetuar a classificacao dos objetos na cena. A primeira rede, do tipo Kohonen, e utilizada para recuperar padroes imperfeitos. A segunda rede, do tipo Backpropagation, associa um codigo de classificacao a cada objeto advindo da rede de Kohonen. Apos a classificacao dos objetos, um sistema especialista baseado em quadros (compilado) identifica a estrutura da cena atraves do uso de regras para encontrar as relacoes entre os objetos classificados. Um prototipo para o reconhecimento de equacoes matematicas, e tambem apresentado, onde detalhes de implementacao do modelo proposto, podem ser observados. Para mostrar a generalidade do modelo proposto, apresenta-se tambem um prototipo para o reconhecimento de formulas quimicas, que foi obtido a partir do outro prototipo, com a substituicao da base de conhecimento do sistema especialista

   83:  Este trabalho propoe uma metodologia de estimacao de propriedades oticas e de fontes de bioluminescencia em aguas naturais a partir de irradiancias medidas in situ. Utiliza-se um algoritmo de inversao implicito, no qual avalia-se, para cada solucao candidata, a diferenca quadratica entre as irradiancias experimentais e aquelas calculadas pelo modelo direto para essa solucao. A funcao objetivo a ser minimizada e avaliada pela soma dessas diferencas quadraticas e o problema de minimizacao e formulado como um problema de otimizacao nao-linear. Para dados com ruido, acrescenta-se um termo de regularizacao por maxima entropia, ponderado por um multiplicador de Lagrange, sendo avaliados dois criterios distintos para escolha do mesmo. O decaimento das irradiancias com a profundidade foi corrigido atraves de um fator exponencial. A metodologia foi testada para dados sinteticos, sem ruido ou corrompidos por ruido gaussiano, com bons resultados. Os casos abordados incluiram estimacao isolada de perfis de bioluminescencia, de perfis do coeficiente de absorcao ou do coeficiente de espalhamento e tambem a estimacao conjunta desses parametros

Obtiveram-se os seguintes resultados relevantes: (a) verificou-se variabilidade dominante na escala anual, a qual se manteve estacionaria; (b) detectou-se variabilidade importante num intervalo de escalas de 2 a 5 anos, a qual nao se mostrou persistente; (c) observou-se outra variabilidade marcante no intervalo de escalas de 10 a 11 anos, aproximadamente, a qual se mostrou persistente; (d) no diagrama resultante da analise da fase do sinal em tempo-escala, apontaram-se regioes com linhas de convergencia de fase. Estas conclusoes sao discutidas e comparadas com outras investigacoes sobre a variabilidade de dados hidrometeorologicos

   83:  A avaliacao de desempenho de um sistema de fila GI/G/m e um classico problema dificil. Estes sistemas de filas com multiplos servidores sao notoriamente dificeis de serem analisados analiticamente, sendo que uma solucao analitica exata somente e possivel para casos especiais, tais como filas M/M/m, M/D/m, M/K2/m, GI/H2/m, GI/Ek/m, GI/Ph/m, Ph/D/m e Ph/Ph/m. Os modelos de simulacao por computadores, apesar de exigirem muitos recursos de hardware (memoria de trabalho e de armazenagem de massa, velocidade de processamento da CPU) e de consumirem muito tempo na execucao das rodadas da simulacao, permitem consideracoes mais proximas das situacoes reais. Os modelos de simulacao podem ser bastante uteis na checagem de suposicoes necessarias num modelo analitico e na checagem dos resultados do modelo analitico. Este trabalho trata da estimacao de medidas de desempenho, em equilibrio, de filas GI/G/m atraves de simulacao. Tambem e tratada a verificacao de aproximacoes de filas GI/G/m por filas Ph/Ph/m

   83:  Neste trabalho foi testado o potencial do modelo de area limitada desenvolvido por pesquisadores da Divisao de Previsao Numerica do Japan Meteorological Agency para simular casos de geadas para o Sul do Brasil. Foram feitas simulacoes usando este modelo com 24 horas e 48 horas de antecedencia ao primeiro dia de geada para 14 casos de geadas intensas que ocorreram na decada de 80. O desempenho do modelo foi avaliado considerando quatro variaveis (temperatura proxima a superficie, pressao ao nivel do mar, ventos e geopotencial em 200 hPa) e comparando os campos simulados com os campos das analises do proprio modelo, bem como os campos correspondentes nas analises do ECMWF. Comparacoes entre os campos simulados e as analises do proprio modelo do JMA mostram que, em geral, o modelo reproduz bem tanto o padrao como os valores das quatro variaveis, principalmente no que concerne as simulacoes com 24 horas de antecedencia. Para simulacoes com 48 horas de antecedencia, embora os padroes simulados e os das correspondentes analises sejam similares, os valores das variaveis em baixos niveis em alguns casos nao foram bem simulados

O sistema foi projetado e construido de acordo com a dinamica de gases unidimensional, teve como diretriz a necessidade de se utilizar componentes e equipamentos disponiveis no Laboratorio Associado de Plasma do INPE. A descarga foi caracterizada eletricamente, ou seja, foram determinadas as curvas caracteristicas da descarga, tensao em funcao da corrente, para diversas condicoes de operacao, as quais foram comparadas com as curvas caracteristicas obtidas por um modelo teorico simples desenvolvido para este sistema apresentando boa concordancia. Verificou-se que o sistema de descarga apresenta dois modos de operacao, que foram denominados modo luminescente e modo arco. No modo luminescente foram determinados os parametros da tocha de plasma: densidade e temperatura eletronica usando sonda eletrostatica dupla e no modo arco foi determinada a frequencia angular de rotacao do arco utilizando um anodo dividido em quatro setores independentes. Foi realizado tambem uma analise da superficie dos eletrodos. Tanto no modo luminescente como no modo arco foram crescidos filmes de diamante que foram caracterizados pelas tecnicas de microscopia eletronica de varredura, dispersao em energia de raio-x, difracao de raio-x e espectrospia Raman. Os filmes produzidos no modo luminescente apresentam uma fase cristalina misturada com uma fase amorfa e pouca uniformidade ao passo que os filmes produzidos no modo "arco" sao bem uniformes porem apresentam somente a fase amorfa

   83:  O estudo meteorologico e dos recursos hidricos do Brasil e de suma importancia para o desenvolvimento socio-economico do pais. Varias tomadas de decisoes, principalmente no setor agricola, dependem diretamente desses fatores. O SIGMET tem como objetivo permitir a consulta, recuperacao dos dados meteorologicos de interesse geral, organizar os diversos tipos de dados, padronizar unidades, formatos e variaveis e uniformizar os criterios de validacao desses dados para que possa atender as necessidades de pesquisa e estudo. A principio serao ingeridos no SIGMET, os dados que faziam parte do BDMET, os quais passarao por um processo de migracao. Alem disso serao coletados e analisados dados meteorologicos e hidrologicos diariamente. Quanto maior a quantidade e melhor a qualidade dos dados coletados, mais precisas, seguras e rapidas se tornarao as analises e previsoes feitas pelos meteorologistas e hidrologistas. Para tanto, faz-se necessario nao so uma infra-estrutura para coleta dos dados como tambem de um Sistema de Banco de Dados que possibilite a organizacao, a integracao, o acesso e facilite a visualizacao dos dados de forma eficiente: o SIGMET. Esta documentacao de Projeto tem por finalidade esclarecer as necessidades de um sistema que manipule informacoes meteorologicas e hidrologicas, as quais foram levantadas por usuarios, engenheiros de software e de hardware e pessoal de operacao e manutencao. Ainda devera especificar os resultados que devem ser alcancados pelo Banco de Dados Meteorologicos - SIGMET

   83:  In this work, we consider the problem of two-impulse orbital transfers between coplanar elliptical orbits with minimum fuel consumption but with a time limit for this transfer. This time limit imposes a new characteristic to the problem that rules out the majority of transfer methods. Then, we used the equations presented by D. F. Lawden, extended them to other constraints and solved those equations to develop a software for orbital maneuvers. This software can be used in future missions developed by INPE. The original method developed by Lawden was presented without numerical results and considers only the case where the initial and final points of the maneuver are known. The software developed extends this method to the case where only one point is known and to the case where the two points are free. The four possible cases were tested with success

Thus, the modifications considering cases with more complex geometry, the implementation and the solutions using this method are contributions of this work.

   83:  Uma das formas de se estudar um objeto em astrofisica e atraves da analise de series temporais, onde podemos caracterizar o comportamento do objeto tanto no seu passado como no seu futuro. Para se fazer esta analise, lancamos mao de metodos de determinacao de periodos. Foi feita aqui a aplicacao de cinco metodos para a variavel cataclismica CZ Aquilae, com o objetivo de determinar o seu periodo orbital. Foram analisados dados fotometricos e espectroscopicos. A analise dos dados fotometricos forneceu um periodo orbital de 0,320273 dia e a analise dos dados espectrocopicos forneceu um periodo orbital de 0,201528 dia. Optamos pelo periodo determinado pela analise dos dados espectroscopicos ja que estes mostraram otimos ajustes e as observacoes fotometricas mostraram um indicio de que este periodo pode ser o do sistema. O espectro de CZ Aquilae, caracterizado por linhas de emissao em H  (6562,8 A) e Hel (5876 e 6678 A), alem de linhas absorcao atribuidas a bandas interestelares difusas, e tipico de uma nova ana, embora suspeite-se que o objeto possa ser do tipo SW Sex (como o objeto nao apresenta eclipses e quase todos os sistemas SW Sex sao eclipsantes, fica dificil fazer uma analise mais conclusiva). Podemos dizer tambem que CZ Aquilae nao seria uma nova ana do tipo SU UMa, ja que estas possuem periodos curtos (da ordem ou menor que duas horas). Outras caracteristicas do sistema: possui uma baixa latitude galactica, tem uma distancia estimada em 243 pc (embora este valor esteja sujeitoa grandes incertezas). A massa da primaria foi estimada no intervalo 0,6 - 1,0 M  considerando a massa da secundaria com o valor de 0,48 M  e a inclinacao orbital foi estimada no intervalo 37  - 53 .

   83:  Vindo de fora da esfera de influencia gravitacional de um corpo celeste, um veiculo espacial pode ter sua velocidade relativa a esse corpo reduzida ao ponto de fazer com que esse veiculo permaneca por algum tempo em orbita em torno desse corpo celeste. Este mecanismo e conhecido como captura gravitacional temporaria, e pode ser utilizado na reducao de consumo de combustivel numa transferencia completa de um veiculo em orbita da Terra para uma orbita em torno da Lua. este trabalho apresenta um estudo sobre forcas que atuam no sistema e, utilizando o conceito da energia de dois corpos para estudar esse fenomeno, apresenta estudos parametricos sobre o tempo de captura e a utilizacao da excentricidade nas manobras de captura gravitacional, topicos ainda popuco explorados na literatura. Alem disso, diversos fenomenos relativos a esse problema foram estudados em detalhes

   83:  A necessidade de se determinar com precisao o nivel de contaminacao das medidas do espectro e da distribuicao angular da Radiacao Cosmica de Fundo em Microondas pelo componente sincrotron da emissao Galactica em radio deu origem a um projeto de colaboracao internacional para mapear o ceu inteiro em comprimentos de onda centimetricos: o Projeto GEM (Galactic Emission Mapping). O experimento consiste em um radiotelescopio portatil de 5,5 m de diametro com uma configuracao de anteparos protetores no solo e no refletor para mapear o ceu em bandas de declinacao de 60 graus, a partir de uma rede de locais de observacao, mediante varreduras circulares centradas no zenite a uma velocidade de 1 rpm. Neste trabalho descrevo em detalhes as minhas principais contribuicoes para este projeto. Primeiro, projetei, construi e testei um receptor de potencia total centrado em 1465 MHz.  Ele possui controle termico duplo para conseguir um amortecimento efetivo das flutuacoes de temperatura ambiente de um fator 66 e alcancar sensibilidade de 20 mK. Segundo, participei ativamente nas campanhas observacionais para otimizar os sistemas radiometricos em 408 MHz e em 1465 MHz e analisar os seus desempenhos na obtencao de medidas de mapeamento. Terceiro, utilizei transitos solares para mapear o feixe principal e a estrutura dos lobulos secundarios (ate 30 graus do eixo principal) do diagrama de radiacao da antena e de seu alimentador helicoidal em 1465 MHz. Modelei seus lobulos de difracao segundo a aproximacao da teoria geometrica no regime de Fresnel. Por ultimo, selecionei 77 horas de observacao e preparei um mapa parcial do ceu em 1465 MHz com uma resolucao angular de aproximadamente 6 graus e cobertura completa em ascencao reta da faixa da esfera celeste compreendida entre +7 graus   +67 graus. Apesar de um desajuste de 250 mK na subtracao da linha de base, o mapa resultante se apresenta praticamente livre dos efeitos de contraste introduzidos pela tecnica de varredura. Neste sentido, ele contorna a incompatibilidade dos mapeamentos existentes em 408 MHz e 1420 MHz na definicao da regiao de brilho minimo do ceu

   83:  Um projeto de restauracao arquitetonica de um predio antigo pode ser feito com mais facilidade se for assistido por um sistema computacional capaz de gerar as dimensoes originais da construcao. Neste trabalho foi desenvolvido um sistema fotogrametrico-digital que oferece um metodo pratico de determinacao das dimensoes reais de um predio para fins de restauracao futura. Desenho arquitetonicos inexistentes de predios antigos parcialmente danificados podem ser obtidos com razoavel precisao usando-se o sistema apresentado. O sistema e capaz de fornecer dados tridimensionais da construcao usando pares estereoscopicos de fotos do predio e um microcomputador. Com esta aplicacao as tradicionais e caras camaras estereometricas tanto quanto os instrumentos restituidores de imagens sao substituidos por cameras comuns relativamente baratas e um microcomputador. apos muitas experiencias realizadas com este metodo foram obtidos dados tridimenionais do objeto estudado com desvios de medidas nao superiores a 2,8
   83:   dos valor reais. Por outro lado, apenas poucas dimensoes apresentaram desvios superiores a 1
   83:   e um numero grande delas nao apresentou absolutamente qualquer desvio. Os desvios dos valores reais apresentados foram atribuidos a falhas acontecidas durante a tomada das fotos e revelacao das mesmas. Foi pesquisada a qualidade esterescopica das imagens tomando-se varios conjuntos de pares fotograficos esterescopicos do objeto, computando-se seus dados e comparando-os com a dimensoes reais do objeto. Imagens digitalizadas e o algoritmo baseado na teoria das paralaxes forneceu os dados 3D os quais foram usados no projeto de restauracao. Pelo processamento  destes dados em um programa CAD foi possivel obter os desenhos arquitetonicos do predio original

   83:  Neste trabalho, realizou-se um estudo observacional e de modelagem dos sistemas de circulacao de verao sobre a America do Sul (AS): Zona de Convergencia do Atlantico Sul (ZCAS), Alta da Bolivia (AB), Vortice Ciclonico (VC) e a Zona de Convergencia Intertropical (ZCIT). Utilizou-se Funcoes Ortogonais Empiricas (EOF) com os dados de vorticidade relativa para 17 veroes, e modelos numericos (modelo de circulacao geral e modelo de area limitada). Os resultados mostram que a formacao da ZCAS nao depende dos Andes, da ZCIT, da conveccao da Africa e da Zona de Convergencia do Pacifico Sul (ZCPS). Entretanto, na ausencia de conveccao tropical sobre a AS, a ZCAS nao se forma. Os Andes sao responsaveis pela localizacao da maxima precipitacao observada durante o verao entre 60 degrees e 50 degrees W e em torno de 10 degrees S. Na ausencia dos Andes, esta zona de maxima precipitacao localiza-se proximo ao Equador, entre 60 degrees e 50 degrees W e em torno de 2,5 degrees S. Portanto, os Andes influenciam indiretamente no posicionamento e na intensificacao da ZCAS atraves da localizacao e intensificacao da maxima precipitacao sobre a parte central da AS. A ausencia da conveccao da ZCIT favorece a ocorrencia de precipitacao na regiao sul do Nordeste. As ondas transientes de numeros de onda zonal 5 e 6 e com periodos de 8 a 10 dias tem influencia na ZCAS. Portanto, para a formacao e manutencao da ZCAS e importante a interacao entre a conveccao tropical sobre a AS e as ondas transientes de numeros de onda zonal 5 e 6, sendo os Andes, a ZCIT e a conveccao da Africa fatores secundarios. Porem, existem outros fatores que modulam a variabilidade intrasazonal da ZCAS. Estas sao, as oscilacoes de 20-30 dias (periodo medio de 22 dias) e de 30-60 dias (periodo medio de 42 dias). Estas oscilacoes tambem estao associadas a teleconexao entre a ZCPS e a ZCAS. A formacao e manutencao do VC quase-estacionario (VCQ) proximo ao Nordeste deve-se a presenca da ZCAS. Os sistemas de circulacao AB, ZCAS e VCQ constituem um sistema acoplado quase-estacionario (SAQE). Este sistema acoplado pode existir na ausencia da ZCIT. Entretanto, a ZCIT do Atlantico tem influencia na intensificacao do SAQE. Neste sistema acoplado, o VCQ depende da ZCAS, a AB depende da conveccao da Amazonia e da ZCAS, a ZCAS depende da conveccao da Amazonia e dos transientes de latitudes medias, e a conveccao da Amazonia depende de fatores de grande escala. Mas existe tambem uma interacao entre cada um dos componentes deste sistema, contribuindo para manter o SAQE por varios dias. Por outro lado, a genese dos vortices ciclonicos transientes (VCT) sobre o Atlantico Sul deve-se a liberacao de calor latente em torno da Bahia, ao sul do Nordeste

Considerando que informacoes sobre o estado de deteorioracao deste sistema podem ser obtidas indiretamente - atraves da inspecao dos seus produtos - e, ainda, que esta informacao pode conter erros, propoe-se uma metodologia utilizando a teoria dos Processos Markovianos de Decisao com Informacao Parcial. Procura-se, assim, unir duas areas de pesquisa - sistemas de inspecao e sistemas de manutencao - e, principalmente, mostrar que erros na informacao fornecida pela inspecao devem ser considerados.

   83:  Utilizaram-se as ionossondas digitais DGS256 (Digissonda), em Sao Luis (MA) (2,3 S; 42 O) e Canadian Advanced Digital Ionossonde (CADI), em Fortaleza (CE) (4 S; 38 O), ambos os instrumentos situados em localidades da regiao equatorial brasileira, para estudar as derivas do plasma ionosferico sobre essas regioes. Procurou-se discutir a validacao do seu uso, por meio de comparacao dos resultados apresentados por esses instrumentos, com os encontrados na literatura, visando uma opcao a mais em termos de instrumentacao, para posterior desenvolvimento de pesquisas a respeito das derivas da ionosfera sobre essas regioes brasileiras. Observou-se que a componente vertical da velocidade de deriva ionosferica apresentada pela DGS256, nao concordou inteiramente com aquela exibida pelo radar de espalhamento incoerente de Jicamarca, devido as diferencas instrumentais. Enquanto que o radar mede a deriva eletromagnetica, a DGS256 mede a deriva aparente. Entretanto, a componente vertical de velocidade de deriva sobre Sao Luis exibe um aumento pre-inversao, apos o por-do-Sol, bem conhecido em latitudes equatoriais. A componente zonal da DGS256 apresentou boa concordancia com a do radar de Jicamarca. A comparacao dos resultados de deriva vertical obtidos tanto com a DGS256 como com a CADI, demonstraram concordancia entre si, somente em algumas faixas de horario, tal concordancia levou a acreditar que as medidas efetuadas por esses dois instrumentos poderiam estar certas. Foram cogitadas hipoteses com relacao a condicoes especificas da configuracao dos campos eletricos da regiao F ionosferica, para explicar tanto a concordancia como a discordancia entre as curvas de componente vertical e zonal de deriva ionosferica obtidas com ambos os instrumentos

   83:  Esta dissertacao apresenta detalhes do desenvolvimento e construcao da unidade de correcao de fases, a qual foi implementada com sucesso, com ajuda dos engenheiros e tecnicos da equipe e com a colaboracao de outros grupos cientificos. Ela e necessaria para obter estabilizacao das fases e uma correta relacao entre os sinais transmitidos por diferentes antenas. A unidade foi testada integrada ao radar de Sao Luis, quando sua operacao foi conduzida durante a campanha operacional e observacional de agosto de 1998. Durante a campanha os primeiros dados da dinamica das irregularidades foram registrados, com resolucao temporal de 6s e de altura de 2,6Km. O software de analise utiliza a tecnica da transformacao de Fourier (FFT) para obter frequencia Doppler dos ecos das irregularidades, e portanto suas velocidades de deslocamento, em um grande numero de faixas de alturas, as quais podem ser ajustadas para cobrir regioes de interesse especifico, para estudos do eletrojato ou de bolhas de plasma. Ele tambem prove a potencia integrada para cada altura, as quais possibilitaram a geracao do mapa de variacao temporal de intensidade de potencia (RTI) em funcao da hora local. A analise do dia 31 de agosto, o qual foi magneticamente perturbado, mostrou grande variacao na intensidade do eletrojato equatorial. Descobriu-se que essas variacoes estavam relacionadas com flutuacoes no indice auroral (AE), nas intensificacoes no campo magnetico do eletrojato equatorial (EEJ) e no indice Dst. Neste dia, a altura das irregularidades apresentou um minimo proximo ao meio dia da hora local. Uma analise detalhada esta em andamento

   83:  Este trabalho discute e faz a simulacao digital, com um simulador dinamico em 3 eixos e seus sensores de angulo na malha, de sistemas de controle de atitude de satelites artificiais. Tem como aplicacao o primeiro Satelite de Aplicacoes Cientificas Brasileiro - (SACI-1) que utiliza um controle de atitude autonomo e sera estabilizado por rotacao com controle ativo da velocidade de rotacao e da sua precessao atraves de bobinas geradoras de torques magneticos interagindo com o campo geomagnetico. O trabalho: 1) utiliza um simulador dinamico em 3 eixos e seus sensores de angulo, uma interface PC-C e seus 'drivers', rotinas de comando e acionamento do simulador dinamico, rotinas de medicao precisa de tempo, e a simulacao "stand-alone" de Prudencio modificada por nos; 2) verifica e caracteriza as ferramentas que sao utilizadas; 3) investiga algumas formas de estimacao de velocidade angular a partir das medidas de angulo; e 4) compara a simulacao "stand-alone" de Prudencio modificada por nos com a simulacao feita neste trabalho. Com base nisto concluimos que e possivel substituir um modelo em software pelo correspondente hardware na malha, que, no nosso caso, foi um simulador dinamico com seus sensores de angulo em 3 eixos

   83:  A identificacao de teleconexoes e a analise de suas influencias na estrutura horizontal da circulacao atmosferica pode ser util para a compreensao da ocorrencia de eventos anomalos em varias regioes do globo. Analises de teleconexoes compreendem uma visao geral da circulacao atmosferica, onde forcantes locais agem para influenciar regioes remotas. Essas analises tem sido usadas principalmente para estudar as flutuacoes de grande escala, de baixa frequencia, na atmosfera. Estudos de teleconex‰es tem fornecido um bom exemplo da uniao entre observacoes, teoria e modelos, como discutido por Hoskins (1983). A teoria de propagacao de ondas de Rossby devido a um forcante local pode explicar as configuracoes de trens de onda obtidos em estudos observacionais e em resultados de modelos, como pode ser visto em Hoskins and Karoly (1981). Contudo, Frededksen and Webster (1988) discutem a necessidade de uma teoria unificada de propagacao de ondas de Rossby e instabilidade baroclinica para explicar as configuracoes de teleconexoes observadas. Essa teoria seria a de instabilidade em tres dimensoes, que poderia ser usada para examinar a ocorrencia de anomalias de baixa frequencia. Um outro aspecto de estudos de teleconexoes e a utilidade destes para previsao de longo prazo. Quando algumas configuracoes de teleconexoes no H.N. foram consideradas em um modelo de previsao, as anomalias encontradas em uma escala maior que a sinotica puderam ser corretamente previstas, como descrito em Opsteegh and Doel (1980). Os primeiros estudos de teleconexoes foram relacionados com a Oscilacao Sul. Analisando dados de pressao ao nivel do mar, Walker and Bliss (1932) encontraram correlacoes negativas entre as regioes do Oceano Pacifico Sul e da Australia/ Oceano Indico

   83:  A Bacia Amazonica possui uma area estimada de 6,3 milhoes de quilometros quadrados, sendo que aproximadamente 5 milhoes em territorio brasileiro e o restante divido entre os paises da Bolivia, Colombia, Equador e Peru. Esta regiao e limitada a oeste pela Cordilheira dos Andes (com elevacoes de ate 6000 m), a norte pelo Planalto das Guianas (com picos montanhosos de ate 3000 m), ao sul pelo Planalto Central (altitudes tipicas de 1200 m) e a leste pelo Oceano Atlantico, por onde toda a agua captada na bacia escoa para o mar. Segundo o IBGE, a area da Amazonia Legal no Brasil e de 5032925 km2, compreendidos pelos estados do Para, Amazonas, Rondonia, Roraima, Acre e Amapa e parte dos estados do Tocantins, Mato Grosso e Maranhao. Imagens de satelites analisadas pelo INPE estimam em 126.000 km2 a area ja desmatada ate 1991, com uma taxa de desmatamento anual de 21000 km2 ano, durante o periodo de 1978-1989, decrescendo este valor para 11.130 km2 ano durante os anos de 1990-991 (INPE, 1992). As regioes que mais sofreram com o desmatamento sao as partes Sul e Leste do Para (apos a construcao da rodovia Belem-Brasilia) e as partes Norte do Mato Grosso e Sul de Rondonia (devido a rodovia Cuiaba-Porto Velho)

A grande vantagem deste metodo reside na possibilidade de, se prever a distribuicao espacial desses parametros (Bamston, 1992). Em todos os modelos, sejam estatisticos ou dinamicos, utilizados em previsao climatica, faz-se necessario o conhecimento das anomalias de TSM dos oceanos tropicais

   83:  Apos o intenso episodio El Nino/Oscilacao Sul (ENOS) de 1982/83, o fenomeno ocorreu novamente em 1986/87, porem com menor intensidade, e de 1990 ao inicio de 1995. Este foi considerado o mais longo evento nos ultimos 50 anos, sendo comparavel apenas com o episodio de 1911-1915, (Halpert et al, 1996). Na Fig.1 sao mostradas as series temporais do indice de Oscilacao Sul, anomalia de pressao em Tahiti e Darwin. e anomalias de Radiacao de Onda Longa, para o periodo analisado. Durante os episodios ENOS, anomalias sao observadas, nao so na regiao de aquecimento do Oceano Pacifico, como em todo o globo. As principais regioes do globo cujas precipitacoes sao relacionadas com o ENOS foram identificadas em Ropelewski and Halpert (1987). 0 mesmo sinal da anomalia nas regioes nordeste (negativo) e sul do Brasil (positivo) encontrado em Kousky et al (1984) foi verificado por Ropelewski and Halpert (1987), embora na regiao sul essa relacao tenha ocorrido de Novembro a Fevereiro. No estudo de Kousky et al (1984), a precipitacao anomala no sul ocorreu no inverno de 1983

   83:  No inicio da decada de 70, Madden e Julian (1971, 1972) aplicando analises espectral e espectral cruzada nos dados diarios de radiosondagem de quase 10 anos de algumas estacoes no Pacifico tropical oeste, detectaram e documentaram oscilacoes com periodo de 40 a 50 dias, daqui em diante referida como oscilacao de Madden e Julian (OMJ). Uma excelente revisao sobre o assunto e encontrada em Madden e Julian. (1994). Estas oscilacoes caracterizam-se por um deslocamento para leste de uma celula zonal de grande escala termicamente direta, que causa variacoes na conveccao tropical. Madden e Julian (1972) apresentaram um esquema ilustrativo das variacoes em tempo e espaco (plano zonal) dos disturbios associados a OMJ

   87:  CIRCULACAO ATMOSFERICA
   83:  A circulacao atmosferica de latitudes medias e caracterizada predominantemente por um escoamento zonal, com deslocamento para leste de frentes, ciclones e anticiclones. No entanto, em condicoes de bloqueio, a presenca de um anticiclone quase estacionario de grande amplitude interrompe a progressao normal dos sistemas para leste. A caracteristica da circulacao atmosferica associada a situacao de bloqueio Ç a divisao do jato em dois ramos, que ocasiona um rompimento do padrao zonal. Na situacao de bloqueio um anticiclone se forma em latitudes mais altas do que aquelas onde se localiza a alta subtropical e e frequentemente acompanhado por uma baixa fria em baixas latitudes. Nesta situacao deve-se esperar, naturalmente, um escoamento mais meridional onde os sistemas transientes; de leste, como cavados e anticiclones, sao desviados de suas trajetorias. Assim, as baixas migratorias ao se aproximarem de uma alta de bloqueio ficam estacionarias ou deslocam-se na periferia da alta, podendo causar condicoes de tempo duradouras sobre grandes areas (Sanders, 1953)

De norte a sul encontra-se uma grande variedade de climas com distintas caracteristicas regionais. No norte do pais verifica-se um clima equatorial chuvoso, praticamente sem estacao seca. No Nordeste a estacao chuvosa, com baixos indices pluviometricos, restringe-se a poucos meses, caracterizando um clima semi-arido. As Regioes Sudeste e Centro-Oeste sofrem influencia tanto de sistemas tropicais como de latitudes mÇdias, com estacao seca bem definida no inverno e estacao chuvosa de verao com chuvas convectivas. 0 sul do Brasil, devido a sua localizacao latitudinal, sofre mais influencia dos sistemas de latitudes medias, onde os sistemas frontais sao os principais causadores de chuvas durante o ano

Tal importancia deve-se as consequencias que estas podem ocasionar, quando ocorridas em excesso (precipitacao intensa), para os setores produtivos da sociedade tanto economico e social (agricultura, transporte, hidrologia, etc), causando enchentes, assoriamento dos rios, quedas de barreiras, etc. Chuva intensa define-se como sendo aquela que registra um grande volume de agua precipitado num curto espaco de tempo. Por exemplo, uma chuva de 20 mm, ocorrida em 24 horas, e considerada fraca, no entanto, este mesmo valor, ocorrido em poucos minutos, que caracteriza a chuva de verao, e geralmente forte e a ocorrencia e conhecida popularmente como pancadas de chuva

   83:  Entre os varios fenomenos atmosfericos que ocorrem no Brasil, a geada e um dos que causam muitos prejuizos, principalmente com relacao a agricultura e a economia do pais. Muitas vezes, o impacto social e economico pelos danos das geadas e significativo, uma vez que envolve fatores tais como a producao e o preco de alimentos. Durante os meses de inverno no Hemisferio Sul (HS), observa-se sobre a. Regiao Sul, Sudeste e Centro-Oeste do Brasil, a ocorrencia de temperaturas baixas, que favorecem a formacao de geadas. Esse fenomeno caracteriza-se pela ocorrencia de temperaturas do ar abaixo de O graus C, com a formacao de gelo nas superficies expostas. Sua intensidade varia e pode ser forte quando resulta da associacao de dois fenomenos: a incursao de massa de ar polar sobre o continente, seguida de perda noturna de energia pela superficie devido a emissao de radiacao infravermelha para o espaco (Molion et al., 1981)

   83:  0 Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) foi desenvolvido na Colorado State University para unificar varios codigos existentes de simulacao numerica de tempo (Pielke,1974; Tripoli e Cotton, 1982; Tremback et al., 1985). Concluiu-se que a unificacao desses codigos, mantendo-se os atributos originais de cada um , facilitava mais efetivamente a pesquisa cientifica no Departamento de Ciencias AtmosfÇricas da Universidade Estadual do Colorado. Alem disso, na fusao dos modelos, uma gama de melhorias foram introduzidas no RAMS, entre as quais a capacidade de aninhamento de grades, que e uma das mais importantes. Baseado no metodo de grades iterativas de Clark e Farley (1984), o RAMS possui a habilidade para representar a larga escala, e entao aninhar-se progressivamente para escalas menores. Mais do que uma grade aninhada pode ser setada dentro do grid de grande escala. As figuras 1, 2, 3 e 4 exemplificam um aninhamento de grades, onde na figura 1 temos o campo de larga escala fornecido como condicoes de contorno para o modelo RAMS, a figura 2 mostra a previsao obtida pelo RAMS com uma resolucao de 80km, a figura 3 mostra o mesmo campo valido para o mesmo horario aninhado a primeira grade com uma resolucao de 4OKm, e a figura 4 mostra o mesmo campo valido para o mesmo horario aninhado a segunda grade com uma resolucao de 2OKm. Notamos que com essa capacidade podemos obter, com o RAMS, um melhor detalhamento dos campos. Na figura 5 temos uma visao de como e feito o aninhamento. 0 RAMS possui uma opcoo nao hidrostatica para que todas as escalas espaciais meteorologicas relevantes possam ser representadas. 0 conceito de modulos "plug-compatible" (Pielke e Aritt, 1984) e usado no RAMS para fazer a assistencia no desenvolvimento de parametrizacoes de interfaces no RAMS. 0 termo Plug-compatibIe quer dizer que a interface entre as subrotinas (i.e., os modulos) e o resto do RAMS e claramente definido pelos usuarios do codigo. Caracteristicas atuais e opáoes do RAMS sao mostradas na Tabela 1 (Pielke et al., 1992) . Um detalhado overview do RAMS e suas opcoes Ç dado em Walko e Tremback (1991)

   83:  Os modelos numericos globais sao muitas vezes complementados por modelos numericos regionais e de area limitada. Uma vantagem no uso de modelos regionais e sua relativa economia computacional em relacao aos modelos globais. Por vezes, a utilizacao de uma fisica mais detalhada e permitida exatamente devido ao relativo baixo custo operacional dos modelos de area limitada. No entanto, a maior desvantagem no emprego dos modelos regionais esta relacionada com as condicoes de fronteiras das quais um modelo de area limitada nao pode escapar. Para uma boa " performance" dos modelos de previsao, tanto os globais quanto os regionais, e importante que as condicoes iniciais representem de forma adequada o comportamento da atmosfera naquele dado instante. A representacao da conveccao profunda, tipica da regiao tropical, e irremediavelmente comprometida quando os campos iniciais de umidade sao incluidos de forma deficiente nos modelos de previsao de tempo

Este modelo e espectral e possui resolucao horizontal de 62 harmonicos que equivale a um espacamento de aproximadamente 200 km. Esta resolucao indica que os valores, numericos das variaveis meteorologicas previstas pelo modelo representam valores medios sobre quadriculos de 200 lan x 200 lan. Para as previsaes realizadas com o MCGA do CPTEC ainda sao utilizadas analises das 00 e 12 UTC geradas pelo NCEP, porem pretende-se usar o modulo de analise do CPTEC para as condicoes iniciais. Resultados de previsoes realizadas com o modelo global do NCEP, o qual possui resolucao de 126 harmìnicos (aproximadamente 100 km), bem como as an†lises com dados observados das 00 UTC sao utilizados para comparacoes e avaliacoes do modelo do CPTEC

As previsoes sao realizadas mensalmente e sao usadas quatro condicoes iniciais de quatro dias consecutivos do meio do mes. Para cada condicao inicial, o MCGA e integrado duas vezes, uma com condicoes de contorno inferior dadas por valores climatologicos da Temperatura da Superficie do Mar (TSM) e outra com TSMs observadas entre a data da condicao inicial ate o mes no qual esta sendo feita a integracao, e anomalias de TSM persistidas para os meses de previsao. Sao feitas medias das diferencas entre as integracoes de previsao-controler para fornecer a previsao do conjunto, para 4 meses. Os resultados mensais e trimestrais sao analisados, com os destaques para as previsoes sazonais. Pretende-se utilizar, no futuro, a TSM prevista atraves de metodos estatisticos (Ver Secao 5) e tambem utilizar um modelo acoplado atmosfera-oceano, para melhorar as previsoes de TSM

   83:  General Circulation Models (GCMs) have predicted substantial changes in the regional climate of Amazonia if forest is replaced by pastureland. Nobre et al. (1991) indicates reduced evaporation and precipitation over the Amazon basin mostly as consequence of a severe and longer dry season. This paper calibrates a land surface parameterization used in GCMs and suitable for climate simulations, the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB), for typical ranchland pasture of central Amazonia. Observed data compare well the simulated fluxes, wether the vegetation is stressed or not due to the soil moisture limitation in the 1990 dry season

   83:  Micrometeorological measurements of energy balance were made over two different kinds of vegetation (pasture and tropical forest) in Central Amazonia, during intensive period in 1990. Solar radiation fluxes over two sites are almost identical, although some differences occurs for netradiation and soil heat flux: the net radiation is higher over forest and the daily range of soil heat flux at pasture is more pronounced. The mean albedo was calculated as 15.7

   83:  Soil profile storage and soil water potential were measured to a depth of 2m beneath pasture and undisturbed rain forest. The maximum water storage change In the 2m profile was 154mm in the forest in both seasons studied, and 131mm and 112mm In the pasture.The behaviour of the storage in the upper metre of the profile was virtually Identical but there were major differences In the second metre, Storage  changes were very similar in the wet season, but In the dry  season the storage under the Forest decreased significantly faster, resulting in 42mm more depletion. This was equivalent to a difference In evaporation rate of O.5mm/d.The forest was able to abstract all of theavallable water from the 2m profile studied andthere was evidence of significant abstraction from below this depth. Soil water availability Is very lowand the forest requires a deep rooting strategy to avoid serious stress in dry periods

   83:  This paper presents the first comprehensive micrometeorological measurements to be recorded over post-deforestation Amazonian ranchland. The ranch was managed for the production of beef cattle and had been created by felling and burning the original rainforest 12 years previously. The measurements allow derivation of the aerodynamic roughness, and a description of the response of the energy balance and surface conductance to the progressing dry season. Zero plane displacement and roughness length were derived from windspeed profiles as 0,17+- 0,03 m and 0,26-+ 0,03 m, respectively, while measurement of energy partition was achieved, with excellent agreement between three independent systems. During the 1990 dry season average evaporation diminished from 3,8 to 2,1 mm d-1 as the Bowen ratio increased from 0,43 to 0,67. Values of surface conductance were derived and these compare well with expected trends

   83:  Links between atmosphere and the vegetation in pristine and disturbed forests can be classified as indirect linkages, which involve atmospheric constituents as an intermediary, and direct linkage through the exchanges of energy, water and momentum between the vegetation and the air above. Here the extent and nature of such forest-atmosphere linkage is explored with respect to information now available from joint Anglo-Brazilian field studies in Amazonia. The proposition is made that the wise management of tropical forests with minimum contribution to climate change will involve land cover which mimics the atmospheric interaction of existing forest. In particular, it will involve deep rooted, perennial vegetation with a dense but uneven canopy, which is persistently growing in nutrient stable soil, and which is managed with minimum use of fire

In the second experiment the Kuo (1974) scheme is included in the model. Both the schemes represented well their caracteristics showing that they call be used together in a global model

   83:  It is analysed the impact of the vertical resolution on an one-dimensional model (vertical X time) including the principal parameterizations used in models for climatic simulations. An interesting effect of a higher vertical resolution is found to be a heating due the long wave radiation below the deep convection and another at the lower stratophere due mainly to ozone absorption. This shows a better capability of absorption of this radiation by the atmosphere, with implications on the greenhouse effect. It is found also a better representation of the shallow convection during the day and a lack of this process during the early morning. Then the mixing layer is better simulated since the processes in the planetary boundary layer are better represented by a higher vertical resolution

The daily evapotranspiration was estimated by using the residuo of the moisture balance equation. The results of this estimatives, are coherents with The mean values calculated by Marques et.al. (1980) using the same metodology. The mean daily rates of precipitation and evapotranspiration in the area of the FLUAMAZON, were 6.4 mm and 3.3 mm, respectively, suggesting that 52

   83:  This paper evaluates two land surface and boundary layer parameter i zat ions used in General Circulation Models (GCMs). A vertical one-dimensional model calculates the surface fluxes based on the Monin and Obukhov theory, and evaporation accordingly to the Penman-Monteith equation, coupled to a turbulent closure model of order zero. For one point in the central Amazon, one day simulations show the evaporation to be overestimated, while still showing numerical oscillations in the boundary layer profile. A new one-dimensional model is coupled to the Simple Biosphere model (SiB) and to a turbulent closure model of order 2,0. The presented calculated fluxes are more realistic when compared to observed data, and numerical noises are now supressed

   83:  0 objetivo principal do Projeto ABRACOS (Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study) consistiu em fornecer dados para melhorar as previsoes dos impactos climaticos causados pelo desmatamento da Amazonia. Esse objetivo pode ser alcancado melhorando-se a representacao, nos Modelos de Circulacao Global (MCGs), da vegetacao de pastagem, que geralmente substitui a floresta, e coletando se dados climaticos a fim de validar algumas das previsoes desses modelos. Dados foram coletados e utilizados para calibrar modelos de parametrizacao da superficie, os quais foram entao usados em experimentos mais realisticos com MCGs.0 Projeto ABRACOS foi realizado em tres areas experimentais da Amazonia brasileira, entre 1990 e 1994. A estrategia consistiu na coleta continua de dados climaticos e de agua no solo nas areas experimentais (floresta e pastagem) dos tres sitios. Estas medicoes foram complementadas por uma serie de seis missoes experimentais, nas quais medidas intensivas micrometeorologicas, de solo e de fisiologia vegetal foram obtidas. Durante o projeto, foi possivel expandir o escopo dos experimentos para incluir: medidas da camada limite atmosferica acima da floresta e pastagem, medidas de fluxos de dioxido de carbono e tambem o uso de sensoriamento remoto para estimar o crescimento de florestas secundarias

   83:  Em areas experimentais (pastagem e floresta) de Maraba (Para), Manaus (Amazonas) e Jiparana (Rondonia), a umidade volumetrica do solo foi medida em varias profundidades ate 3,6 m. Sao apresentados tres anos de dados para os sitios de Manaus e dois anos para os demais. Entre os sitios, devido a diferenáas nas propriedades do solo, cobertura vegetal, duracao da estacao seca e comportamentodo lencol freatico, houve grande diferenca na variacao sazonal do armazenamento de agua no solo. A variacao sazonal foi consistentemente maior na floresta, em comparacao a pastagem. A menor variacao ocorreu nos sitios de Manaus, os quais tiveram estacao seca mais curta. Neste caso, a maxima variacao registrada no perfil de 2 in foi de 154 mm para a floresta e de 132 mm para a pastagem. No perfil de 3,6 m, a maxima variacao na floresta foi de 200 mm. A maxima variacao na floresta de Maraba foi de 724 mm, o qual foi a maior variacao registrada entre os sitios, e na pastagem, foi de 349 mm. A floresta e pastagem de Ji-Parana apresentaram, como maxima variacao, 701 mm e 5 11 mm, respectivamente, mas houve importante contribuicao da drenagem saturada nesses valores. 0 lencol freatico elevou-se ate 1,2 m da superficie na floresta, e ate 2,4 m na pastagem, o que indica a necessidade de se levar em conta o comportamento do lencol freatico e o movimento lateral de agua no solo nos resultados apresentados para Ji-Parana. Nos sitios de Manaus e Maraba, parece nao ter havido influencia do lencol freatico. Houve extracao de agua abaixo de 3,6 m em todos os sitios de floresta. Apesar da variacao sazonal do perfil ter sido pequena em Manaus, a retirada de agua a maiores profundidades foi necessaria devido a baixa disponibilidade do oxisol nesse sitio. Ao final da estacao seca de 1993, estima-se que cerca 38

A extracao de aguanapastagem foi fortemente afetada pelo deficit hidrico do solo. A pastagens de Ji-Paranafoi amenos afetada,com a taxa de extracao de agua, ao final da estacao seca, de 2,5 mm d-1, enquanto em Manaus foi de 1,2 mm d-1 e em Maraba, somente 0,61 mm d-1.  A floresta de Maraba foi o £nico sitio onde nao houve recarga completa do perfil na estacao umida. A estacao seca de 1993 iniciou-se com um armazenamento 400mm menor que a estacao seca de 1992. Houve pequena recarga abaixo de 2,5 me a estacao seca subsequente iniciou-se com um deficit substancial (no perfil medido, e provavelmente abaixo). Nao e sabido, ate o presente, a frequenciade ocorrencia desse tipo de evento

   83:  A difusividade termica do solo (K) - igual a razao entre a condutividade termica (k) e a capacidade termica "bulk" (C) - e um importante parametro para a determinacao da distribuicao da temperatura e do fluxo de calor no solo. Este parametro, que contribui para a caracterizacao do microclima do solo, depende do conteudo de umidade, bem como da composicao e da textura do solo. Medidas da temperatura do solo as profundidades de 10, 20 e 40 cm, sob diferentes condicoes de umidade, foram utilizadas para determinar K em duas areas desmatadas, com solos argiloso e arenoso, da Fazenda Dimona (Manaus) e da Fazenda Nossa Senhora (Ji-Parana), respectivamente. Compararam-se varios metodos para a obtencao de K, incluindo uma solucao numerica da Equacao de Conducao de Calor. Utilizaram-se as temperaturas do solo nas profundidades de 10 a 40 cm como condicoes de contorno, e um perfil de temperatura inicial medido, para obter valores otimizados de K que ajustem a temperatura em 20 cm. Os valores de K sao apresentados como funcao do armazenamento de agua no solo ate a profundidade de 40 cm. Encontraram-se tambem relacoes lineares entre este armazenamento e a umidade em diferentes profundidades. Obteve-se um valor medio de K, para nove dias selecionados e utilizando o metodo numerico, iguala 1,45x 1 0 6 m2 s-1 para o solo arenoso, valor este consistente com aqueles obtidos pelos metodos analiticos. Com uma amostra de dois dias para o solo argiloso, obtiveram-se valores menos consistentes de K, variando de 0,07 a 0,45x10 6 m2 s-1

   83:  Um modelo uni-dimensional simples foi utilizado para estudar o crescimento da camada limite convectiva (CLC) desenvolvidas sobre superficies de floresta e pastagem na regiao Amazonica do Brasil, durante o Experimento da Camada Limite de Rondonia. Este modelo foi baseado na teoria desenvolvida por Tennekes (1973) e e capaz de reproduzir algumas das caracteristicas observadas da CLC, embora diferencas do valor final da temperatura potencial e virtual e altura da camada limite tenham sido observadas. Estas diferencas sao maiores para a simulacao realizada para a pastagem. Os resultados de uma nova simulacao, na qual o modelo e integrado a partir do instante em que a conveccao 1ivre toma-se dominante, mostrou melhores resultados. Baseado nestas analises, sugere-se que possa existir uma fonte de turbulencia extra no inicio da manh∆ na area de pastagem e que o modelo uni-dimensional nao contabiliza. Esta turbulencia e gerada pela existencia de circulacao tecnica secundaria. devida a justaposicao de areas de floresta e pastagem e e muito importante na erosao da camada limite notuma

Determining the climatic effects of Amazonian deforestation has been the subject of many general circulation model (GCM) experiments over the past few years, for example Dickinson and Henderson-Sellers (1988), Lean and Warrilow (1989), Nobre et al. (199 1), Lean and Rowntree (1993), Henderson-Sellers et al. (1993) and Manzi (1993). All these simulations have agreed that, following total deforestation of the Amazon basin, there would be an increase in air temperature (by 0.6 to 2.0 degrees C), a reduction in precipitation and evaporation (20 to 30
   83:  ) and the dry season would become longer. Such modifications tothe climate wouldhave serious ecological consequences for the Amazon region

   83:  0 papel das florestas tropicais no balanáo global de carbono ainda e impreciso. Pode se entender melhor as interacoes de troca de carbono entre a atmosfera e a biosfera atraves da utilizacao de modelos biofisicos e de circulacao da atmosfera. Os resultados destes modelos entretanto dependem muito de sua utilizacao e desempenho. Este trabalho descreve um metodo de calibracao do modelo SiB2 utilizando medidas de fluxos de energia e de carbono, coletados atraves do metodo da covariancia dos turbilhoes na floresta tropical da Reserva Biologica do Jaru, sudoeste da Amazonia, durante a estacao umida de 1993. As simulacoes do modelo, utilizando-se os parametros otimizados de relacionamento da atividade fotossintetica e condutancia estomatica, levaram a comparacoes satisfatorias com os dados observados. Os parametros otimizados foram utilizados em um exercicio de simulacao do modelo, forcado por dados meteorologicos de superficie coletados nos tres sitios de floresta tropical amazonica do ABRACOS (Reserva Ducke, Reserva Biologica do Jaru e Reserva Vale do Rio Doce), de outubro de 1990 a Dezembro de 1994. A simulacao representa uma tentativa de se avaliar os fluxos calculados por um modelo calibrado floresta tropical pode funcionar como um sorvedouro de carbona ao longo de toda a estacao umida.

   83:  Parametros de superficie, para vegetacao de pastagem e floresta na Amazonia, sao apresentados para a utilizacao em experimentos de desmatamento realizados por modelos de circulacao geral (MCG). Os valores dos parametros sao baseados, predominantemente, nas medicoes registrada pelo projeto ABRACOS, e complementados, quando necessario, pelos resultados de outras pesquisas na Amazonia. Os parametros sao independentes dos diversos esquemas de transferencia Solo-Vegetacao-Atmosfera (ETSVA) atualmente em uso, entretanto, quando um particular submodelo e utilizado para calibrar um parametro, a estrutura do submodelo e apresentada. A variacao sazonal dos parametros de vegetacao e apresentada quando possivel. Na floresta, sob a influencia da umidade de solo, o albedo medio mensal variou de 0, 121 a 0, 144, ao passo que, na pastagem, sob uma variacao no indice de area foliar entre 0,5 e 4,0, o albedo variou de 0, 155 a 0,20. A rugosidade aerodinamica, z , nos sitios de pastagem, foi consistentemente 10
   83:   da altura da vegetacao, variando de z  = 0,025 m a z,, = 0,08 m, e foi encontrada como sendo independente do indice de area foliar. A media da rugosidade de dois sitios de floresta foi de z  = 2,35 m. Parametros obtidos em tres diferentes tipos de solo na Amazonia (Latossol, Podssol e Terra Vermelha) sao dados com uma distribuicao geografica simples, consistente com a limitada informacao disponivel para uma modelagem representativa do sistema solo-agua. Os parametros de retencao e relativos a dinamica da agua no solo sao apresentados para varias profundidades, entretanto, a existencia de raizes profundas nas florestas, consequencia da ausencia de sazonalidade na transpiracao, requer cuidado na escolha, pelos modelos, da profundidade do sistema radicular. Para a modelagem da transpiracao, acondutancia estomatica"bulk" continua como o resultado empirico dos metodos de otimizacao: a falta de independencia para com os outros parametros dificulta a compreensao da diferenca entre os sitios. Tambem a influencia da estrutura das plantas no albedo, transpiracao e evaporacao do solo nao esta ainda bem acoplada em muitos ETSVA. Para modelagem hidrologica, o detalhado mapeamento pedologico da Amazonia e insuficiente e pouco completo com relacao aos parametros do sistema solo-agua. Estudos de sensibilidade utilizando os parametros publicados pelo estudo do ABRACOS sao agora necessarios para investigar a importancia relativa de cada uma das areas de pesquisa em trabalhos futuros. Recent initiatives to improve models of soil, plant andatmospheric processes (Wilson and Henderson-Sellers, 1985; Lean and Rowntree, 1993; Manzi and Planton, 1994) and to calibrate model parameters accurately (Shuttleworth, 1988; Shuttleworth and Dickinson, 1989; Sellers et al., 1989) have significantly improved the realism in models of land-surface processes (Sellers et al., 1986; Warrilow et al., 1986; Noilhan and Planton, 1989). These advances have made it possible to construct and compare plausibly modelled climate scenarios for forested anddeforested Amazonia (Dickinson and Henderson-Sellers, 1988; Lean and Warrilow, 1989; Nobre et al., 1991; Polcher and Laval, 1994; Manzi and Planton, 1996; Lean et al., 1996). Generally, these simulations of deforestation have predicted increases in surface temperature and decreases in rainfall and evaporation when Amazonian forest is replaced with pasture

   83:  As parametrizacoes dos processos de superficie usadas nos MCGA (Modelos de Circulacao Geral da Atmosfera) foram bastante aprimoradas na u ultima decada, com a inclusao de uma representacao explicita da vegetacao e dos processos fisicos relacionados a ela. No CNRM (Meteo-France) um novo esquema, chamado de esquema ISBA (Interacoes entre Solo, Biosfera e Atmosfera) desenvolvido por Noilhan e Planton (1989), foi implementado no AGCM Espectral EMERAUDE (Manzi e Planton, 1994). Este acoplamento ISBA/AGCM e uma ferramenta poderosa para se investigar mudanáas de origem natural e antropogenica nas superficies continentais, como os processos de desertificacao ou desmatamento. Neste artigo sao apresentados resultados de uma simulacao de desmatamento de 4 anos sobre a Amazonia, onde a floresta tropical chuvosa natural e as savanas, de uma extensa area da America do Sul foram substituidas por pastagens degradadas. 0 esquema ISBA foi testado cuidadosamente usando dados dos experimentos observacionais ARME (Experimento Micrometeorologico da Regiao Amazonica) e ABRACOS, respectivamente, para floresta e pastagem. A simulacao com a Amazonia desmatada mostrou um enfraquecimento do ciclo hidrologico e uma amplificacao do ciclo diurno da temperatura de superficie quando comparada com a simulacao de controle. Um estudo de sensitividade mostrou a grande importancia do albedo de superficie e do comportamento da rugosidade na resposta ao desmatarnento.The climatic effects of large scale deforestation are caused by complex interactions between the soil-vegetation system, clouds, radiation and the general circulation of the atmosphere. GCMs allow these to interact freely, making them uniquely powerful tools for simulating different climate change scenarios. A new land surface scheme ISBA (Interactions Sol-Biosphere et Atmosphere) has been developed at CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Metdorologiques), the research institute of Meteo-France, for inclusion in the forecast, climate and mesoscale models. This scheme (Noilhan and Planton, 1989), despite its simplicity, represents all the principle physical processes present in more complex hydrological and ecological models of the soil-vegetation interface. Water and heat transfer through the soil depend on soil texture and moisture content; vegetation dependent processes such asthe interception of rainfall and dew are treated explicitly, and transpiration is restricted by a surface resistance

   83:  Experimentos de desmatamento da Amazonia foram conduzidos utilizando-se o MCG do Hadley Centre. As caracterisitcas da floresta e pastagem foram obtidas a partir dos dados do Projeto ABRACOS. A completa retirada da floresta Amazonica produziu as seguintes modificacoes medias (para toda Amazonia): reducao na evaporacao em 0,81 mm d-1(19
   83:  ) e na precipitacao em 0,43 mm d-1 (7 
   83:  ), e aumento na temperatura da superficie em 2,3 graus C. Estes resultados assemelham-se aos obtidos em experimentos anteriores. Entretanto, as diferencas relativas em magnitude indicam que o aumento na convergencia de umidade compensa, parcialmente, a reducao de evaporacao, em contraste com a maioria dos experimentos anteriores. Os resultados tambem mostram grandes diferencas regionais na variacao da precipitacao media anual sobre a America do Sul, com reducao sobre a maior parte da area desmatada e aumento proximo aos Andes. Um experimento de desmatamento, confinado a uma area reduzida mais realista, mostrou que as maiores reducoes de precipitacao se localizaram sobre a floresta remanescente na Amazonia Central, ao inves de sobre a area desmatada. Em outra serie de experimentos, variando-se separadamente a rugosidade, albedo e infiltracao maxima do solo, foi examinada a resposta do clima em face a essas modificacoes. Estes experimentos indicaram que o clima final, gerado pelo modelo, e muito dependente dessas variacoes discretas nos parametros e e fortemente influenciado pela interacao nao linear destas variacoes.In recent years a numberof general circulation model (GCM)experimentshavebeen conducted to assess the impact of complete removal of the South American tropical rainforest on climate. A summary of the most recent experiments is presented in Tabie 1 (an updated version from Pitmanetal,(1993). Differences in the specification of two important vegetation characteristics, albedo and roughness are given; the irnposed increases in albedo ranges from 5
   83:   to 8
   83:   and the decreases in roughness from 0.76 to 2.57 m. Results vary wldely between experiments: increases in surface temperature range from 0. 1 to 2.3 degrees C, decreases in precipitation from. 15 to 640 mm year-1 and decreases in evaporation from, 25 to 500 mm year-1. This study will address four key issues raised by an assessment of these experiments

The results described in this book should therefore be regarded as orily the start of the analysis and application of the ABRACOS data. However, many new insights into the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interactions for Amazonian forest and pasture have already been derived. This paper presents a summary of the main results so far and the conclusions to which they lead

   83:  As atividades humanas, como queima de fluidos fosseis e queimadas nas florestas, tem levado a um aumento significativo na concentracao de gas carbonico, na atmosfera. Esta concentracao aumentou a partir da era pre-industrial (1860) de 290 partes por milhao de volume (ppmv), para niveis atuais de 350 ppmv, e estimativas mostram que deve ser dobrada entre os anos de 2025 e 2050 (Bach, 1979). 0 gas carbonico possui alta transmissividade para a radiacao solar e grande absorvidade para a radiacao de onda longa (emitida pelo sistema terra-atmosfera). Esta propriedade faz com que um aumento na concentraá∆o de gas carbonico leva a uma intensificacao do efeito estufa. 0 objetivo deste trabalho e simular, usando um modelo climatico simples, os efeitos causados ao se dobrar a concentraá∆o de gas carbonico

Normally, the meteorologist works with great data sets, so the graphics representation of these data associated with satelite or radar images are important resources to study the climate behavior. In that way, systems of meteorological data visualization have proved that they are important tools for the meteorologists. The author, based in the knowledge obtained working in the INPE project to implement the system of meteorological data visualization MicroMAGICS and in the reasearch work developed in the Space Science and Engineering Centre in Madison USA, where he studied techniques to generate tridimensional graphics, analyse in this paper an algorithm to generate tridimensional surfaces that can be used to visualize many phisical fields, in special, the fields related to the climate

   83:  Este trabalho discute e simula o controle em tempo discreto de satelites artificiais com apendices flexiveis, e a sua estabilidade em funcao de periodos de amostragem crescentes. Devido a aumentos crescentes da demanda de servicos no segmento espacial as dimensoes dos apendices tendem a crescer tornando-se asim mais flexiveis. Como resultado, e importante investigar  os efeitos das caracteristicas digitais tais como a amostragem no tempo, atrasos (em entradas, processamento e saidas) e a quantizacao em amplitude. Neste trabalho somente os efeitos da amostragem no tempo sao investigados. O projeto de um controlador Proporcional+Derivativo (PD) em tempo discreto e feito considerando aspectos tais como o mascaramento ("aliasing") e as oscilacoes  escondidas ("hidden oscillation"). O controlador PD e testado com 2 plantas: um oscilador harmonico, e um modelo do satelite "China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite" - (CBERS-1), comparando o PD analogico, com PDs discretos obtidos por mapeamentos s-z classicos (Tustin e Schneider), e por um novo mapeamento s-z proposto neste trabalho, usando as mesmas condicoes de simulacao (ganhos de controle, etc) para efeitos de comparacao. O criterio de estabilidade de Jury, root-loci, respostas transitorias, e respostas em regime com aquelas plantas foram usadas para analisar seus desempenhos. Varios metodos de estabilizacao sao inferidos. Dentre eles, o uso do novo mapeamento apresentou o melhor desempenho, mostrando-se promissor

   83:  A maioria dos procedimentos para analisar e controlar o comportamento de um sistema considera supervisao centralizada. Entretanto, em alguns sistemas complexos, a suposicao de supervisao centralizada nao e a mais adequada. Em alguns casos, uma melhor alternativa seria adotar uma supervisao descentralizada, que consiste de varios supervisores, e cada um observando uma parte do sistema. Neste trabalho tem-se como objetivo apresentar uma estrategia que permita a modelagem de sistemas com supervisao descentralizada. Para isto propoe-se uma metodologia utilizando a teoria dos Processos Markovianos de Decisao com Informacao Parcial. Resultados numericos sao apresentados onde se aplica a metodologia proposta na otimizacao de um sistema produtivo

   83:  Neste trabalho foi utilizado um metodo iterativo implicito de inversao (MIII) para obtencao de perfis verticais de temperatura, baseado no processo de inversao matematica da Equacao da Transferencia Radiativa (EITR).Basicamente este metodo procede a minizacao de um funcional composto por uma norma quadratica mais um termo de regularizacao, utilizando em sua resolucao uma rotina numerica de minimizacao. Alem das funcoes classicas de regulamentacao de Tikhonov, utilizou-se regularizacao baseada no principio da maxima entropia. Numa primeira etapa, apresenta-se uma serie de simulaá‰es baseada em dados gerados sinteticamente a partir da EITR, onde foi possivel proceder varios testes, tais como convergencia, comparacao com outras tecnicas e analise de erro. Em seguida, aplica-se o MIII a uma situacao real com dados de radiancias fornecidas pelos sensores do HIRS/2 (Right Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder). Finalmente, apresenta-se uma comparacao com perfis obtidos por radiossondagem. De um modo geral, os resultados obtidos nas simulacoes realizadas para avaliar a tecnica atestam o bom desempenho do MIII, sobretudo nos niveis de pressao que vao da superficie ate a inversao da tropopausa, que e a regiao de maior interesse meteorologico

   83:  Com o crescente aumento da complexidade e porte dos sistemas, e importante que os aspectos dinamicos sejam observados com cuidado na fase inicial do desenvolvimento desses sistemas. Este trabalho faz um levantamento de elementos que contribuem na especificacao e representacao mais efetiva dos aspectos dinamicos dos sistemas, a partir do estudo de alguns casos. Baseado no resultado desta analise e na atual carencia de tecnicas que plena e adequadamente representem estes aspectos, propoe-se uma nova abordagem para a sua representacao, com  a criacao de modelos de animacao. Estes modelos sao criados graficamente utilizando um simbolismo simples e a animacao e obtida com o emprego de tecnicas de simulacao discreta de sistemas, dentro de um ambiente de facil uso e que possibilita a interacao do modelador do sistema durante o processo de animacao. Com isso, uma visao da dinamica do sistema e obtida, melhorando a compreensao e, consequentemente, a especificacao dos aspectos dinamicos. Por meio de sucessivos refinamentos do modelo, e possivel, ainda, que o modelador obtenha a especificacao de alguns dos objetos de software componentes do sistema a ser implementado

   83:  Medidas micrometeorologicas de superficie realizadas nas areas de floresta e de pastagem do Projeto ABRACOS na regiao de Ji-Parana foram utilizadas para avaliar o balanco de radiacao, o desempenho de formulas empiricas na estimativa da radiacao de onda longa atmosferica e o balanco de energia para o final da estacao chuvosa e inicio da estacao seca do ano de 1993. O desempenho de 5 diferentes equacoes de estimativas de radiacao de onda longa da atmosfera (Ld) foi avaliado para area de pastagem na Amazonia. De um modo geral, as estimativas de Ld, a partir desses modelos, subestimara a Ld, medida, resultando em valores de desvio medio quadratico (DMQ) de 50,7 a 75,2 Wm-2 , assim como valores negativos de erro medio absoluto (EMA) de 73,0 a -49,1 Wm-2. Isto pode estar relacionado aos coeficientes utilizados nessas equacoes que sao especificas para os locais nos quais foram desenvolvidas, diferentes das condicoes ambientes de pastagem na Amazonia. Um ajuste local desses coeficientes foi realizado, obtendo-se, com isso, melhores estimativas de Ld pelos modelos em que a emissividade e funcao somente da temperatura do ar. Os indices estatisticos das equacoes ajustadas, mostraram coeficientes de correlacoes (R) proximos a unidade, pequenos valores de DMQ e EMA proximos de zero. A particao de energia foi avaliada, e os resultados indicaram que durante o periodo chuvoso, a devolucao de energia para a atmosfera e realizada predominantemente pelo fluxo de calor latente cuja fracao do saldo de radiacao (LE/Rn) utilizada foi 0,79 na floresta e 0,65 na pastagem. Uma pequena parte (H/Rn) e usada para o aquecimento da atmosfera, correspondendo a 0, 17 na floresta e 0,20 na pastagem. No periodo seco, a floresta continua a utilizar uma maior quantidade de energia para evaporar e uma menor quantidade para aquecer o ar, enquanto que na pastagem a transferencia de energia para a atmosfera ocorre em magnitudes muito proximas dos fluxos de calor latente e calor sensivel, principalmente nos horarios entre 11 e 14 Hora Local (HL). No caso do evento de friagem, a devolucao de energia para a atmosfera e realizada predominantemente pelo fluxo de calor latente antes da passagem, cuja fracao do saldo de radiacao (LE/Rn) foi igual a 0,79 para a floresta e 0,71 para a pastagem. Durante a friagem, a fracao de LE/Rn na floresta foi superior a unidade, enquanto que na pastagem a fracao de LE/Rn foi igual a 0,88. Apos a passagem da friagem, a fracao de LE/Rn e H/Rn na floresta e na pastagem retornam ao padrao antecedente a friagem. No caso do evento de nevoeiro, a forma de devolucao de energia para atmosfera tambem e realizada predominantemente pelo fluxo de calor latente, cujo valores da razao de Bowen foram positivos ate 9 HL

   83:  The impact of smoke aerosols on the surface solar irradiance in the Rond6nia region of Brazil is examined. The climate of this region is subequatorial, with two distinct seasons. There is a sharp decline of the precipitation and cloudiness during the dry season which lasts from June to September accompanied by anthropogenic burning of savanna and forest in August and September with the resultant strong emission of smoke into the troposphere. Thus the magnitude of the column aerosol optical depth increases in these months while both precipitable water and cloud amount decrease in accordance with the seasonal cycle of humidity. All these atmospheric constituents influence the Magnitude of the solar irradiance at the surface. In order to assess the aerosol and gaseous effects on the surface irradiance as compared with impact of cloudiness, we performed the clear-sky radiative transfer model calculations by employing a broadband radiation code and both aerosol optical depth and precipitable water retrieved from Sun photometer measurements. Calculation results show that the elevated aerosol optical depth observed in Rond6nia during August and September causes a negative trend in the daily mean clear-sky surface solar irradiance during this period. Since the daily mean solar irradiance measured at the surface under all-sky conditions demonstrates a similar negative trend, it can be explained by the aerosol influence while the effect of clouds appears in the daily variations of the irradiance. It was also shown that smoke aerosols cause a decrease of the monthly mean values of all-sky surface irradiance in August and September as compared with July and October. Corresponding decreases in the near surface air temperature due to the smoke aerosols were not found

The data was gathered during a meteorological experiment (PYREX) to study the airflow around a mountain ridge: the Pyrenees. We present the spatial distribution and the various lengthscales of the energy fluxes computed from turbulence data (thermodynamics) for four specific flows : 1) Mechanical turbulence in the lee side of the mountain; 2) Mountain lee waves and small scale turbulence; 3) Coherent structures wit in Tramontana wind over the Mediterranean sea and 4) Inhomogeneous and strongly turbulent valley wind (Cierzo wind). These two latter local winds are generated by the Pyrenees mountain range

   83:  In a recent paper Sinclair ( 1995, hereafter SI) made a climatological study of cyclogenesis in the Southern Hemisphere using seven years ( 1980- 86) of European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) data. Geostrophic vorticity at 1000 hPa is used to locate cyclones and determine their intensity. In an earlier study Gan and Rao (1991, hereafter GR91) also examined the cyclogenesis using the surface pressure charts for four hours an each day for the period January 1979 December 1988. Their study was for South America (the area enclosed by 15 degrees-50 degrees S and 30 degrees-90 degrees W). In GR91, the method used to manually identify surface cyclogenesis was that at least one closed isobar around a low pressure center should be found for an analysis of 2-hPa intervals. The purpose of this comment is to compare the results of these two studies for the South American region in a recent paper Sinclair ( 1995, hereafter SI) made a climatological study of cyclogenesis in the Southern Hemisphere using seven years ( 1980- 86) of European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) data. Geostrophic vorticity at 1000 hPa is used to locate cyclones and determine their intensity.

Their study was for South America (the area enclosed by 15 degrees-50 degrees S and 30 degrees-90 degrees 'W). In GR91, the method used to manually identify surface cyclogenesis was that at least one closed isobar around a low pressure center should be found for an analysis of 2-hPa intervals. The purpose of this comment is to compare the results of these two studies for the South American region

   83:  During 9-11 August 1988, a cyclone developed over Uruguay in the lee of the Andes Mountains and moved over the South Atlantic Ocean, where it redeveloped into an intense storm. This storm was responsible for unusual wave activity along the Brazilian shoreline from 22 degrees to 32 degrees S. The Brazilian news media reported the loss of at least one life, waves of 3 m and higher, and the disappearance of a drainage pipe, which weighed 8000 kg, off the shores of Rio de Janeiro. In this paper, the evolution of this intense storm and the associated ocean wave response is studied through European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses, a hydrostatic limited-area meteorological model, and a second-generation prognostic wave model. Tbe atmospheric model results indicated the presence of a long-lived and large fetch with surface. kind velocities higher than 12m s -1 directed toward the coast. Some areas with velocities of 20 m s-1 wereembedded in the fetch. The wave model forced by this wind field was able to simulate waves with a significant height of 8 in far from the coast and about 4 m in regions very close to the Brazilian coast in agreement with the occurrence reported at Rio de Janeiro. The swell propagation toward the coast of Rio de Janeiro was obstructed by a northeastward 10-m wind during the first 24-h period of the model's integration. During the second 24-h period, the fetch was still large and strong, but the obstacle was removed by a counterclockwise rotation of wind direction favoring the swell and windsea, propagation toward the Rio de Janeiro coast

A transformada em ondeletas foi aplicada para detectar a ocorrencia de ECs no sinal turbulento atraves da determinacao da variancia dos coeficientes da ondeleta para cada uma das escalas possibilitadas pelas condicoes de amostragem do sinal. Os resultados, obtidos para os fluxos de momentum e de calor sensivel, sob condicoes convectivas, determinados pelo metodo das covariancias aplicado a dados medidos a uma altura de 25,26 m e a uma frequencia de aproximadamente 21 Hz mostram que a participacao das ECs nos fluxos tende a diminuir com o aumento da instabilidade atmosferica. Graficos dos sinais projetados em tempo-escala, obtidos atraves da aplicacao da ondeleta do chapeu mexicano aos dados, permitem que se formule uma explicacao fisica para os resultados

O objetivo de uma boa rotulacao e mostrar a posicao geografica das entidades com texto associado, de forma legivel, e respeitando as convencoes cartograficas, com qualidades estetica e harmonica na apresentacao dessas informacoes. Abordamos o problema de rotulacao cartografica sob o ponto de vista de otimizacao combinatoria. Nesta perspectiva, a rotulacao cartografica pertence a classe de problemas de dificil solucao, conduzindo-nos a necessidade de algoritmos de aproximacao, uma vez que nao existe nenhum algoritmo exato capaz de soluciona-lo em um intervalo de tempo aceitavel. Nossa pesquisa consistiu na avaliacao do algoritmo de otimizacao Busca Tabu aplicado a rotulacao cartografica. A Busca Tabu implementada no SCARTA, um software de producao cartografico em desenvolvimento pela Divisao de Processamento de Imagens do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, mostrou-se um algoritmo eficiente, nos casos-teste real e aleatorio, Quando comparado a tecnicas alternativas como "Simulated Annealing", algoritmo genetico com mascara, e outras descritas na literatura, a Busca Tabu apresentou o melhor desempenho em qualidade. Concluimos que a Busca Tabu e um metodo recomendavel para solucao de problema de rotulacao cartografica de pontos, devido a sua simplicidade, praticidade, eficiencia e bom desempenho, conjugado a capacidade de gerar solucoes de qualidade em tempo computacional aceitavel

   83:  Neste estudo, procurou-se compreender os mecanismos de geracao e modos de propagacao de micropulsacoes Pc3-5, em latitudes muito baixas e equatoriais. Usou-se dados simultaneos observados com uma cadeia de 10 estacoes geomagneticas. no territorio brasileiro, dispondo de magnetometros "fluxgate" de alta sensibilidade. Utilizou-se o metodo de estimacao espectral por multiplas janelas, baseado na Transformada Rapida de Fourier (FFT), para obter os espectros de potencia, parametros de polarizacao e fase das micropulsacoes. Observou-se um aumento na ocorrencia das pulsacoes Pc3-5 altamente polarizadas, atingindo o maximo proximo ao meio-dia local (14:00 e 15:00 UT) nas estacoes mais proximas ao equador magnetico. Os espectros dinamicos mostraram a ocorrencia de 81 eventos simultaneos de pulsacoes Pc3-4 com alto grau de polarizacao, principalmente durante o dia. Os eventos diurnos mostraram um aumento de 3,2 vezes na densidade de potencia polarizada para as pulsacoes observadas nas estacoes proximas do equador magnetico em comparacao com as mais distantes. As fases das pulsacoes mostraram atrasos entre 48' e 62' nas estacoes equatoriais em relacao as mais distantes. Estes efeitos estao relacionados ao aumento da condutividade ionosferica e da intensidade de eletrojato equatorial. As curvas de densidade de potencia polarizada para as 10 estacoes mostraram um comportamento identico, com picos maximos ocorrendo na mesma frequencia. Isto esta possivelmente relacionado ao modo de oscilacao global da cavidade plasmasferica. A elipticidade mostrou-se quase-linear, com eixo maior na direcao norte-sul, devido ao fato de que as oscilacoes poloidais das linhas de campo magneticas sao quase desacopladas. A amplitude da componente norte-sul mostrou-se maior que a oeste-leste. Estes resultados sao uma evidencia de que o mecanismo da ressonancia das linhas de campo nao explica as micropulsacoes Pc3-4 observadas em latitudes muito baixas e equatoriais. O aumento na ocorrencia de eventos Pc3-4 durante o dia., com maximo proximo ao meio-dia local e presenca predominante do modo poloidal (compressional), esta provavelmente associado com a propagacao da onda compressional, proveniente da instabilidade ion-ciclotronica na regiao da frente de choque, que se propaga na magnetosfera em baixas latitudes. A propagacao desta onda pode excitar o modo compressional aprisionado ou o modo global compressional. O fenomeno resultante, das oscilacoes forcadas das linhas de campo na plasmasfera, e o mais provavel mecanismo fonte das pulsacoes Pc3-4 em latitudes muito baixas e equatoriais

   83:  Interannual variations of rainfall in Northeast (NE) Brazil are studied giving emphasis to the unusually heavy rainfall during 1984 and 1985. It is found that a more southward location of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone is probably responsible for the higher rainfall in 1984 and 1985. In 6 of the 9 states, rainfall correlates significantly with corn yields. In 7 of the 9 states, the Southern Oscillation (SO) index shows a strong positive correlation with annual corn yields. This suggests that the SO index can be used to predict annual corn yields in NE Brazil. The feasibility of predicting annual corn yields in Northeast Brazil from prior observations of the Southern Oscillation index is examined. It is found that good success can be obtained in some states

This portion is basically the combustion efficiency and depends on the type of forest, on how the trees were cut and piled, on the material size and the biomass moisture. content, among others

The astronomical peaks 19,000 and 23,000 years related to Earth's precession and 41,000 years related to Earth's obliquity were also observed but weakly. For earlier periods (800 ka - 2400 ka B.P.), nine peaks were observed (including 41,000 and 100,000 years) but weakly.

   83:  0 Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) opera uma rede de medidores de radiacao ultravioleta solar tipo B (UV-B) na superficie terrestre desde o inicio da decada de 1990, em varias localidades no Brasil, na Bolivia, no Chile e na Antartica. Os instrumentos sao constituidos de medidores de banda larga (Biometro) e de banda estreita (radiometro UV de superficie, espectrofotometro Brewer). Varias analises de dados de UV-B sao apresentadas, com enfase em uma metodologia derivada do metodo de Langley para obtencao de espessuras opticas atmosfericas na regiao espectral do ultravioleta. A metodologia foi aplicada aos dados de radiacao global do espectrofotometro Brewer. Os resultados obtidos para a espessura optica atmosferica total foram comparados com resultados derivados de medidas de radiacao direta utilizando tambem o Brewer, e a concordancia entre ambos resultados foi boa. Com isto, a obtencao dos dados de radiacao UV-B da rede do INPE podera ser usada tambem sistematicamente, para o estudo de aerossois. A metodologia desenvolvida foi tambem testada com os Biometros, apesar destes nao se enquadrarem nos requisitos do metodo de Langley. Os resultados obtidos com os instrumentos Biometros, para a espessura optica atmosferica total, foram concordantes com os obtidos pelo instrumento Brewer, em 310 e 320 nm. Abstract: The National Institute for Space Research (INPE), operates a network of solar ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation meters, at ground level, since the 1990's, at sites in Brazil, Bolivia, Chile and Antarctica. The ultraviolet meters are broadband meters (UV-Biometer), and narrowband meters (Ground-based Ultraviolet Radiometers, Brewer Ozone Spectrophotometers). Several analyses of UV-B radiation are presented, with emphasys on a methodology derived from Langley's method to calculate the atmospheric total optical depth in the UV-B. This methodolgy was then applied to global radiation data measured by the Brewer spectrophotometer. The total optical depths obtained with global radiation were compared with total optical depths obtained with direct radiation data, also measured by the Brewer spectrophotometer, with good match. The methodology to calculate optical depths was then tested also for UV-Biometer data, although these do not follow the Langley requirements. The results obtained with UV-Biometer data for total optical depth were in good agreement with optical depths calculated from the Brewer data, at 310 and 320 nm

   83:  Na regiao da Bacia Taubate foram realizadas treze sondagens magnetotel£ricas compreendidas num perfil que cortou transversalmente a bacia em sua parte mais espessa, denominada sub-bacia de Tremembe, e prolongou-se pelas limitrofes Serra do Mar a sudeste e Serra da Mantiqueira a noroeste. Os dados foram interpretados atraves de um modelo de inversao bidimensional e os resultados testados por uma modelagem direta. Uma camada condutora a 10 km de profundidade foi observada claramente sob as regioes cristalinas, mas nao foi detectada sob as rochas sedimentares. Tal fato pode estar associado a efeitos de encobrimento resultantes da alta contutancia dos sedimentos da bacia. A presenca dessa camada condutora na crosta medio-inferior parece ser uma caracteristica global, sendo detectada sob as mais diferentes estruturas geologicas. Aqui, porem, apresentou uma condutancia anomalamente baixa para uma regiao retrabalhada no Neo-Proterozoico. Este aspecto deve ser considerado na formulacao de qualquer modelo de evolucao tectìnica da area. Abstract: Thirteen magnetotelluric soundings were carried out in the Taubate basin region. They were positioned along a profile cutting across the thickest part of the basin, named Tremembe sub-basin, and extending over the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira, respectively to the southeast and northwest. The data were interpreted through a 2-D inversion scheme and the results were tested through a forward modelling. A 10 kin deep conductive layer was observed quite clearly under the crystalline regions but was undetected under the sedimentary rocks. The latter can be probably associated with screening effects due to the high conductance of the surficial sediments. Studies at different tectonic regions in the world have reported the same conductive layer at around the same depth but in the present study the layer has an anomalously low conductance considering that it is a region which was reworked during the Neo-Proterozoic. These findings are strong constraints to any tectonic model suggested to explain regional features

   83:  Apresenta-se uma analise de 22 relampagos negativos descendentes registrados no Brasil entre 1985 e 1994, na Estacao de Pesquisa do Morro do Cachimbo (43 58' 26" W, 20 00' 39" S), da Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG). Faz-se um resumo do historico da pesquisa de correntes de descargas capturadas em torre e descreve-se a tecnica de medida. Comparando-se os primeiros choques de retorno com aqueles de outra estacao de pesquisa na Suica, observou-se que as curvas de corrente sao muito similares nos dois paises, embora a intensidade media dos picos da corrente no Brasil (40 kA) seja maior que aquelas na Suica (30 kA) e o instante em que ocorre o pico no Brasil (22  s), seja maior que na Suica (13  s). Diferencas foram percebidas tambem nos choques subsequentes. Para explicar tais diferencas foi desenvolvida uma   extensao ao modelo de Borovski onde a condutividade do sistema canal-torre-atmosfera-solo pode ser calculada diretamente da curva de corrente. As condutividades foram calculadas pelo novo modelo ajustandos-e as curvas medias, obtendo-se 1.21 x 10  (  m)  no Brasil e 2.74 x 10  ( m)  na Suica. As diferencas entre os valores dos picos de corrente e condutividade encontrados foram explicadas com base no calculo dos campos eletricos, usando-se a lei de Ohm. Ha uma correlacao linear (94
   83:  ) entre o instante em que a corrente atinge o pico e aquele em que a derivada da corrente e maxima. Os terceiros choques apresentaram correntes mais intensas que os segundos e uma explicacao para esse fato foi apresentada. Componentes M foram registradas em torno de 200  s com valores de pico (2 kA) sendo atingidos em tempos menores que aqueles registrados em componentes M registradas apos 1 ms em outras estacoes de pesquisa

   83:  Neste trabalho utilizou-se a Iniciacao por Filtro Digital (IFD) para remover as oscilacoes de alta frequencia geradas na integracao de um modelo de area limitada que surgem devido ao desequilibrio existente entre os campos de massa e velocidade nos dados iniciais. Com a finalidade de avaliar o impacto do Filtro Digital (FD) em remover frequencias pre-determinadas, implementou-se este filtro num modelo linearizado onde apenas solucoes do tipo ondas de gravidade sao permitidas. Com os experimentos realizados, conclui-se que ao selecionar ondas de um determinado periodo para serem excluidas, a amplitude desta onda e amortecida aproximadamente 50
   83:   do seu valor inicial e ondas imediatamente menores sao eliminadas. Assim, o FD aplicado ao modelo idealizado confirmou sua eficiencia em remover ondas de gravidade. Posteriormente a IFD foi implementada no modelo atmosferico de area limitada (LAM) desenvolvido na agencia meteorologica japonesa. A Condicao Inicial (CI) foi a analise do National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) do dia 31 de dezembro de 1979 as 12:00 UTC. Neste periodo houve a intensificacao de um ciclone sobre o Oceano Atlantico causando condicoes de tempo severas. Utilizou-se uma serie temporal de 12 h na filtragem das variaveis prognosticas. Atraves de quatro experimentos com a IFD para periodos de corte (tc) de 1 h, 2 h, 3 h e 4 h e um sem filtro, concluiu-se que o para a serie de 12h, o tc=3h reduz com maior eficiencia as oscilacoes de alta frequencia. Outros 3 experimentos foram idealizados com a finalidade de estudar o efeito da iniciacao: EXP-1, onde nenhuma iniciacao e realizada; EXP-2, onde o modelo e 4 integrado por 6 horas para amortecer ondas de alta frequencia; EXP-3, com a IFD implementada. Com estes experimentos concluiu-se que a IFD remove as oscilacoes de alta frequencia da simulacao e nao degrada a previsao, isto e, a intensificacao, evolucao e desenvolvimento do ciclone foram simuladas satisfatoriamente. Sob o ponto de vista computacional este esquema e bastante vantajoso por ser nao recursivo, pois nao exige que a serie a ser filtrada seja armazenada. Com a implementacao do FD no LAM, o tempo computacional de uma previsao operacional de 48 horas, aumentou de aproximadamente 15 para aproximadamente 18 minutos numa Estacao de Trabalho Digital de 400 MHz

   83:  Os mecanismos fisico-quimicos envolvidos nos estagios iniciais da nuvem tem importancia fundamental no desenvolvimento da precipitacao. Este trabalho aborda as propriedades envolvidas no crescimento de goticulas por condensacao de vapor d'agua no interior de nuvens. O crescimento por condensacao, de acordo com a teoria de Howell, nao considera os efeitos da turbulencia e, consequentemente, nao representa caracteristicas probabilisticas envolvidas no crescimento de goticulas em nuvem. Os efeitos de um ambiente turbulento sobre os estagios iniciais do desenvolvimento de uma distribuicao de goticulas crescendo por condensacao em nuvens quentes foram investigados. Neste trabalho, estes efeitos foram analisados atraves de um modelo conceitual, no qual o campo de supersaturacao no entorno das goticulas e flutuante no tempo e os termos devido a curvatura da goticula e devido a presenca de um soluto sao mantidos na equacao de crescimento. O uso de um modelo simplificado de turbulencia para simular um campo de supersaturacao mostra que, quando movimentos turbulentos estao presentes, podem ocorrer mudancas na forma da distribuicao do tamanho das goticulas. Os resultados obtidos mostram que a turbulencia pode causar um, alargamento da distribuicao, e que este alargamento e mais pronunciado na regiao das goticulas menores

   83:  As funcoes-peso de dez canais da "Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit" (AMSU) do sistema "Advanced TIROS-N/NOAA Operational Vertical Sounder" (ATOVS), calculadas utilizando o modelo de transferencia radiativa "Atmosphere Transmission at Millimetric and Submillimetric Wavelenghts" (ATM), foram comparadas com as funcoes-peso definidas para a AMSU/ATOVS. Dos dez canais, cinco referem-se as linhas de absorcao do oxigenio em torno de 57,29 GHz, que constituem a unidade AMSU-A (canais 2, 4, 5, 6 e 8), e os outros cinco estao associados as linhas de absorcao do vapor d'agua em torno de 183,31 GHz, que compoem a unidade AMSU-B (canais 16 a 20). Foram utilizados perfis verticais atmosfericos padroes, implicitos no modelo ATM (tropical, latitudes medias de verao e inverno), e perfis verticais climatologicos de temperatura e umidade da atmosfera de regioes do Brasil. A atual versao do modelo ATM estabelece uma parametrizacao do coeficiente de absorcao dos gases, atmosfericos em microondas mediante o fornecimento de perfis verticais de pressao, temperatura, umidade e concentracao de gases da atmosfera. Alguns parametros de entrada tambem sao fixados, tais como: emissividade da superficie, angulo de visada do sensor e frequencia central do canal. As funcoes-peso calculadas utilizando os perfis atmosfÇricos do modelo sao comparadas com as estabelecidas para o Brasil e com as da AMSU/ATOVS. Alem disso, foi realizado um estudo sobre as variacoes espacial e sazonal das funcoes-peso no Brasil. Tambem verificou-se a influencia da emissividade da superficie terrestre e do angulo de visada do sensor no calculo das funcoes-peso. Os resultados mostraram consistencia entre as funcoes-peso para maioria dos canais da AMSU-A. Para os canais da AMSU-B, observou-se uma discrepancia entre as funcoes-peso obtidas com os diversos perfis climatologicos. Isto sugere a definicao de funcoes-peso mais especificas para o Brasil. A emissividade da superficie e o angulo de visada do sensor exerceram forte influencia em algumas funcoes-peso dos canais das AMSU-A e AMSU-B

   83:  Nuvens Magneticas sao estruturas interplanetarias originadas em Ejecoes de Massa Coronal Solares (EMCS). Sao identificadas por possuirem: campo magnetico intenso (normalmente > 10nT1); grande rotacao do vetor direcao do campo magnetico enquanto a nuvem passa pelo ambiente espacial do satelite observador e medidor; baixa temperatura e baixo valor parametro beta (      ). Esta dissertacao apresenta um estudo das caracteristicas e parametros de plasma e campo magnetico das Nuvens Magneticas, para um conjunto de eventos previamente publicados em literatura especializada e para um novo conjunto de eventos selecionado que ocorreram no ano de 1979. E apresentada a existencia de uma correlacao estatistica linear entre a velocidade de propagacao das Nuvens Magneticas com o modulo da intensidade de seu campo magnetico intrinseco, levando a conclusao de que: Nuvens Magneticas que se propagam no Meio Interplanetario com maior velocidade possuem maior intensidade de campo magnetico. Esta associacao parece ser propriedade exclusiva de Nuvens Magneticas, uma vez que outras Ejecoes de Massa Coronal Interplanetarias (EMCI)3, nao-nuvens, nao apresentam estas caracteristicas e correlacoes. Os parametros velocidade e campo magnetico estao relacionados a ocorrencia de Tempestades Geomagneticas. As interacoes entre Nuvens Magneticas e estruturas circunvinhas no Meio Interplanetario sao aqui investigadas atraves do calculo da Pressao Total: Termica, Magnetica e Dinamica, a fim de relaciona-las com a intenficacao do campo magnetico total das Nuvens Magneticas. Esta dissertacao contribui para: (1) a previsao do Clima Espacial atraves da obtencao da intensidade do campo magnetico de Nuvens Magneticas atraves de medidas de velocidade, que podem ser feitas atraves de imagens de coronografos, dois a tres dias antes de sua chegada a Terra; (2) a investigacao da ligacao entre Nuvens Magneticas e Tempestades Magneticas Terrestres; (3) o estudo das interacoes entre Nuvens Magneticas e estruturas do Meio Interplanetario

Desta maneira, faz-se necessario que se procure por solucoes que tentem erradicar, ou pelo menos minimizar, os problemas encontrados durante o desenvolvimento destes Sistemas, os quais influenciam negativamente na qualidade e na produtividade. Um destes problemas consiste na falta da definicao precisa, dentro da organizacao, de um Sistema para o desenvolvimento de Sistemas de Software. Este Sistema deve envolver um processo de desenvolvimento, bem como os recursos e as pessoas disponiveis. Neste trabalho, e apresentado um Sistema para o desenvolvimento de Sistemas de Software baseados na arquitetura SOFTWARD, detalhando as atividades do Processo de desenvolvimento correspondentes a modelagem do Componente do Dominio do Problema (CDP) da SOFTBOARD, atraves da utilizacao dos conceitos de estrategias e padroes

   83:  A crescente necessidade de uma melhor resolucao nas imagens de sensoriamento remoto traduz-se em exigencias de melhoria na precisao da determinacao e do controle da atitude dos satelites. Por esse motivo, e grande, por parte dos estudiosos do setor, a procura por solucoes que garantam o cumprimento de tais exigencias. Este trabalho tem por objetivo o estudo da possibilidade e viabilidade da utilizacao de uma imagem comum de sensoriamento remoto na determinacao e no refinamento da atitude do satelite possibilitando com isso a integracao da camera de imageamento ao sistema de controle e determinacao da atitude do veiculo espacial. Uma das grandes vantagens dos resultados deste trabalho e que estes podem ser facilmente implementados via software, sem necessidade de equipamento adicional, uma vez que o hardware utilizado (camera de imageamento, computador de bordo) ja se encontra embarcado

   83:  Com a crescente popularizacao e aumento de desempenho dos computadores pessoais, a Computacao Grafica ganhou novo alento. A Computacao Grafica, fortemente impulsionada pela industria de entretenimento, e provavelmente um dos ramos da computacao que tem evoluido mais rapidamente nos ultimos anos. Este rapido desenvolvimento tem gerado novos desafios aos alunos e professores da area por exigir um grande esforco de aprendizado e atualizacao. Este trabalho pretende mostrar que o aprendizado de Computacao Grafica pode se dito de maneira interativa, por meio do computador. Para tal, em vez da abordagem tradicional de livros, mostrar-se-a que textos escritos em HTML e com hyperlinks (ligacoes automaticas entre paginas, bastando clicar com o mouse em cima das palavras sublinhadas) podem ser mais eficientes. Para mostrar a viabilidade desta nova abordagem, foram escolhidas algumas areas da Computacao Grafica que, embora nao sejam as mais basicas, sao de dificil aprendizagem em funcao da dificuldade destes topicos econtrarem-se concentrados na literatura ou pela complexidade dos conceitos. Tal e o caso da interpolacao, onde nao basta apenas saber utilizar um interpolador, mas e preciso analisar-se o contexto para selecionar o interpolador mais adequado a cada caso. Outro tema vasto e que ha alguns anos era tratado de forma independente da Computacao Grafica e o Processamento de Imagens. Neste trabalho apenas alguns topicos da vasta area de Processamento de Imagens serao mostrados. Finalmente outro topico que requer analise e reflexao e a Manipulacao de Objetos Tridimensionais. Neste caso tambem, apenas uma pequena secao do assunto sera mostrada. Em principio seria possivel apresentar um grande numero de exemplos e implementacoes, como ate chegou-se a cogitar no inicio dos trabalhos, porem, devido ao alto custo em tempo para desenvolver as implementacoes, que foram implementadas pelo autor especialmente para este trabalho, optou-se por apresentar apenas um pequeno numero de aplicativos. Esta opcao foi sugerida pelo Comite que avaliou a Proposta de Dissertacao, onde a banca examinadora optou por limitar o escopo do trabalho aos topicos efetivamente apresentados, visto se tratar de uma Dissertacao de Mestrado e nao de um projeto de software comercial. Espera-se que o texto seja usado por professores e alunos com algum conhecimento de Computacao Grafica, de preferencia em C++ e/ou JAVA, como leitura complementar ou de referencia. Abstract: With the growing popularization and increase of performance of personal computers, the Graphic Computation won new encouragement. Strongly impelled by the industry of entertainment, it is probably one of the branches of the computation that has been developing faster in the last years. This fast development has been generating new challenges to the students and teachers in the area for it demands a great effort in learning and updating. This work intends to show that the learning of Graphic Computation can be done in an interactive way, by means of the computer itself For such, instead of the traditional study books, it will be shown that texts written in HTML and with hyperlinks (automatic connections among pages, sending the reader from underlined words to related subjects with a mouse click) can be more efficient. To show the viability of this new approach, there were chosen some areas of the Graphic Computation that, although not among the most basic ones, are of difficult learning because they are hardly found concentrated in the literature or have complex concepts. That is the case of interpolation, where knowing how to use an interpolador is not enough, once you need to analyze the context to select the most appropriate interpolador for each case. Another vast theme that some years ago was even independent from Graphic Computation is Image Processing. In this work only a few topics from the vast area of Image Processing will be shown. Finally other topic that requests analysis and reflection is Three-dimensional Objects Manipulation. In this case also, just a small section of the subject will be shown. It would have been interesting to present a great number of examples and implementations, which was cogitated in the beginning of the works. Nevertheless, due to the high cost in developing implementations, which were done by the author especially for this work, he opted for presenting only a small number of applications. This option was suggested by the Committee that evaluated the Proposal of Dissertation, where the examining bank opted indeed for limiting the the work to the topics presented, once the target was a Master Degree Thesis and not a commercial software project. It is hoped that the text will be used by teachers and students with some knowledge of Graphic Computation, specially of C++ and/or JAVA, as a complementary resource or reference.

   83:  This work intends to show some aspects about the mechanical layout and modeling of a BAPTA (Bearing and Power Transfer Assembly) mechanism in development involving a government institution (INPE) and private companies. The design here described is being evolved for application in small satellites (0.5 kW with a rigid solar panel of1 .0 kgm2). The selected concept uses a conventional 1.8 degrees stepper motor and a 100:1 harmonic drive reduction gearing to achieve a theoretical output step size of 0.018 degrees. Simulations in computer are showing that significant interaction with the solar array and spacecraft can be avoided (spacecraft pitch disturbing velocity is on order of 10-5 deg/sec) with power consumption as low as 5 W. The adequate determination of the power consumption is possible due to a adequate representation of magnetic nonlinearity in the motor, including its effect on electromagnetic torque production. The reliable prediction of the important dynamic characteristics of the motor and general system necessitates a precise representation of the flux-linkage data. A good example is the single-step damping, which can be predicted satisfactorily only if the current disturbance and associated power loss in each stator circuit are calculated correctly. This requires that the rate of change of flux-linkage be defined accurately for any combination of the system variables

   83:   A localizacao de transmissores atraves de satelites, em tempo quase-real, atende necessidades de busca e resgate de pessoas em locais remotos, acompanhamento de boias oceanograficas e o monitoramento de animais em pesquisas cientificas; No caso dos satelites NOAA (norte americano) atualmente, a determinacao da posicao destes transmissores e feita atraves do sistema frances "ARGOS", o qual fornece a localizacao, mas nao em tempo quase real, e exige acesso a computador especifico no exterior. Neste trabalho sera desenvolvida uma metodologia de calculo baseado em "desvio Doppler "para uso em micro-computadores comuns, que permite a localizacao geografica dos transmissores em tempo quase-real. Esta tecnologia, ainda inexistente no pais, quando empregada com estacoes de recepcao portateis dos sinais Argos, podera ser tambem usada em trabalhos de campo com baixo custo operacional. Adicionalmente, o sistema de localizacao podera realizar as mesmas funcoes atraves dos satelites brasileiros SCD (Satelites de Coleta de Dados), e CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite)

Este es el primer instrumento instalado en Chile con el proposito de estudiar el comportamiento y la evolucion de la capa de ozono, en la zona poblada mas cerca de la Antartica, donde desde hace unos anos, a comienzo de la primavera Austral se manifiesta el fenomeno de la formacion M "Hoyo de Ozono Antartico". En este trabajo se presenta un analisis de practicamente dos anos de mediciones hechas con el espectrofotometro Brewer, como tambien un analisis mes a mes, de septiembre a diciembre (1992-1993), de la evolucion de la capa de ozono. Ademas se muestra la disminucion mas pronunciada detectada hasta ese momento sobre Punta Arenas, cuando el dia 5 de octubre de 1992 se midieron 185 UD, que es un valor casi 50

   83:  Stratospheric ozone measurements were made at the Brazilian Antarctic station Ferraz, near the Antarctic Peninsula, during 1992 using ECC ozone sondes launched on balloons. The technique has been used extensively before In the Brazilian tropics, for measurements of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. This work Is part of the Brazilian CIRM PROANTAR Program, with logistic support of the Brazilian Air Force and Navy. The measurement period extended from March to November 1992. A total of 43 ozonesondes were sucessfully launched. The ozone layer over Ferraz was observed with and without ozone depletions. Ozone Is observed to be depleted at several heights, not only near the peak of the layer (22 km), but also at levels In the lower stratosphere, where depletion may be quite severe. The Antarctic ozone hole was observed on several occasions during August, September, and October, when the partial pressure of ozone was reduced by about 50
   83:   near the layer peak, in general. but being much larger in some cases. The hole condition was in general quite variable. In the lower stratosphere, around 15 km, intense ozone reductions were observed on several soundings, when the ozone partial pressure practically vanishedm

   83:  We present the results of two South Pole missions to search for cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy in the 25-35 GhZ, 26-36 Ghz and 38-45 Ghz ranges, respectively in the summers of 1988/1989, 1990/1991 and preliminary results of the 1993/1994 mission. All the missions were carried out using a Gregorian off-axis, 1 m diameter, 1 m focal telescope and a cooled optical system mounted on top of a stabilized platform: the Advanced Cosmic Microwave Explorer, also known as ACME. For the first mission we used 4He-cooled SIS (Superconductor-Insulator-superconductor) amplifiers operating at a frequency of 90 Ghz at an angular scale of O.33 degree and placed a 95
   83:   confidence level upper limit of  T/T  3.5 x 10-5  for CBR fluctuations with a Gaussian auto correlation function at a coherence angle of 30'. The second and third missions were accomplished using HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) amplifier based detectors. The receivers operated at 25-35 GHz in the second mission and the measurements set 95
   83:   confidence level upper limits of  T/T  1.4 x 10-5 at a coherence angle of 1.2 degree for a 9-point data set. The 13-point data set measurements yelded a 95
   83:   confidence level upper limits of T/T  1.6 x 10-5 at a coherence angle of 1.5degree. The latest, 1993/1994 mission detectors operated in 2 bands: 26-36 GHz and 38-45 GHz. The combined results present a preliminary detection  T/T  1 x 10-5. at a coherence angle of about 1 degree. Specially the results of the latest mission belong to a new set of very sensitive CBR measurements that detected fluctuations on medium angular scales. Medium angular scale measurements are crucial to the understanding of structure formation processes and will help us discriminate among the many different existing models. Antarctica, due to Its unique conditions, is one of the best sites In the world to carry on this kind of science

   83:  A semi-annual oscillation (SAO) in Southern Hemisphere surface pressure and Its associated exchange of atmospheric mass between middle and high latitudes have been reported in the literature. An attempt is made to detect an SAO signal In a 14-year run of an NMC global model of resolution T62 provided with observed surface boundary conditions. By means of spectral analysis and averaging of monthly pressure tendencies, It is concluded that the model data do show the existence of a signal at this frequency, with significant amplitude and variable phase

Estes constituem-se em rapidas variacoes na amplitude elou fase da propagacao sub-lonosferica de ondas de VLF/LF. Os eventos Trimpi apresentam caracteristicas distintas quando observados em diferentes latitudes e longitudes.

   87:  BURACO DE OZONIO
   82:  <SANTA MARIA (RS)>
   83:  Um decrescimo relativamente grande na coluna de ozonio estratosferico foi observado no sul do Brasil (29,5 graus S) em 1993, no final de outubro. Este decrescimo de ozonio foi observado quando o comportamento normal da coluna de ozonio em latitudes baixas deveria mostrar valores anuais maximos, de modo que tal decrescimo e inesperado. As medidas locais de ozonio estratosferico foram feitas usando duas tecnicas distintas. Dois sistemas independentes de espectrofotometro Brewer, que detectaram um forte decrescimo da coluna de ozonio em Santa Maria, e tambem a distribuicao vertical da concentracao do ozonio foi observada com sondas de ozonio lancadas em balao, o que mostrou uma diminuicao uniforme da concentracao de ozonio com altura na estratosfera, com valores muito baixos de ozonio na baixa estratosfera. Estes baixos valores na parte mais baixa da estratosfera sao uma caracteristica dos perfis obtidos na Antartica, na primavera. Alem das duas tecnicas citadas, dados de ozonio do sistema NASA- TOMS, representando uma terceira tecnica distinta de observacao de ozonio estratosferico, indicaram otima correlacao com as tecnicas locais, o que nao deixa duvidas quanto a realidade do decrescimo de ozonio observado no sul do Brasil em outubro de 1993. A magnitude do fenomeno observado pode ser considerada elevada. Isto porque, por comparacao, a magnitude da variacao sazonal e de ordem de 30 Unidades Dobs(UD), sendo que um dos decrescimos observados chegou a profundidade de 60 UD. Parece que nao existe mecanismo fisico ou quimico conhecido na estratosfera de latitudes baixas, que possa ser responsabilizado por tal variacao anomala, e tao intensa. No entanto, o periodo particular do ano, e inspecao dos dados TOMS de coluna de ozonio nos dias de observacao das perturbacoes em pauta, mostram uma clara ligacao (em termos de concentracao de ozonio) entre a regiao do buraco de ozonio da Antartica e o sul da America do Sul. Esta ligacao estende-se para o norte sobre o oceano Atlantico, num caminho curvado para oeste, atingindo as latitudes tropicais

   83:  The mesospheric hydroxyl(OH) emission layer is photographed in the Meinel infrared(IR) band from selected ground stations in India using common 35mm cameras equipped with f/1.2 lenses, special IR filters and IR sensitive films. The spectral range of the night glow emissions photographed is limited on the short wavelength side by the Wratten 88A filter with 50
   83:   cut-off at 758nm and on the long wavelength side by the sensitivity of the special emulsion on the IR sensitive film(50
   83:   cut-off at 895nm). In this wavelength region, the night glow spectrum contains dominantly the (9,4), (5,1), (6,2) and (7,3) rotation-vibration bands of OH, generally known as the Meinel bands, with an integrated brightness of about 7kR. These ground photographs clearly exhibit regular time varying wave patterns extending in wavelength from a few kms to thousands of kms, that are thought to be manifestations of the well-known gravity waves. Preliminary results from photographic observations made from low and middle latitude stations in India, namely Kemmanagundi (75.7 degreesE, 13.5 degreesN), Jogimatti (76.40 degreeE, 14.1  degreeN), Gadag (75.6 degreeE, 15.4degreesN), Mount Abu (72.8 degrees E, 24.7 degreesN) and Gulmarg (74 degreesE, 34.O degreesN) are presented here. They strongly suggest the need to extend such studies to higher latitudes and also to the antarctic region

   83:  During the period July 07-10, 1994, damage frost and snow fall occurred at several places over southern Brazil as a result of a strong cold air outbreak. The meteorological conditions associated with this episode are Investigated In this study using satellite Imagery, conventional data and the NMC grid point analysis. During this period cold air advection from sub-antartic latitudes was observed In the low and medium troposphere. Also, a cut-off low and a trough merged In the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. The cut-off low coming from the Southeast Pacific Ocean crossed the Andes mountain following a quasi zonal path along 30 degrees S and reached southwestern Atlantic near Uruguay. The trough amplified northwestward from sub-polar latitudes in the South Atlantic. The position of this cold low In the vicinity of southern Brazil and the establishment of a split flow pattern In the Southeastern Pacif ic Ocean channeled cold air equatorward favoring the occurrence of frost and snow fall In southern Brasil. An analysis of the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation shows that the advection of relative vorticity was responsible for the eastward movement of the cut-off low. The results of this study suggest that subantartic circulation plays an Import role In the sequence of events that preceeded this case

Empregou-se para as determinacoes um equipamento cujo principio de operacao baseiase na atenuacao optica de um feixe de luz de referencia sobre um filtro de microfibra de vidro, onde os aerossois sao depositados durante amostragens continuas. 0 periodo de monitoracao foi de maráo Ö dezembro de 1993. A media anual encontrada foi de 6,51 Ò 5,46 ng.m-3. Os dados obtidos nao permitiram concluir de forma inequivoca se o grande numero de estacoes de pesquisa na regiao eleva o nivel de concentracao do CE atmosferico. Podese observar, contudo, a contribuicao de Ferraz em curtos periodos de tempo. Uma interpretacao preliminar dos dados de CE e da meteorologia local mostrou que a adveccao de ar "contaminado" oriundo do continente sulamericano pode elevar o nivel de CE durante as passagens dos sistemas frontais de baixa pressao pela regiao

   83:  Um estudo de caso de uma nuvem virgula Invertida associada a forte adveccao fria de latitudes subantarticas e a subsequente ocorrencia de ventos fortes na Bacia de Campos (litoral do Rio de Janeiro), foi realizado com o objetivo de diagnosticar as principais caracteristicas sinoticas de sua evolucao temporal. 0 caso ocorrido no periodo 09 a 13/06/89, foi estudado atraves de analises Isobaricas utilizando-se dados do European Centre for Mecilum Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), dados meteorologicos convencionais e Imagens de satelite. Os resultados mostram que o sistema se formou nas proximidades do Paragual, em baixos niveis (850 a 700 hPa), na retaguarda de um sistema frontal frio, com suporte dinamico em altos niveis. No estagio nascente desse disturbio observou-se nos baixos niveis uma forte adveccao de ar polar que contribuiu para a formacao do vortice. No estagio maduro houve Intensa convergencia de umidade e adveccao de ar quente nos baixos niveis. Finalmente, no estagio de dissipacao, o forte influxo de vapor d'agua oriundo do Oceano Atlantico contribuiu para a formacao de chuvas abundantes no litoral da regi∆o sudeste e ventos intensos (mais de 20 m.s-1) na Bacia de Campos

   83:  During the solar cosmic ray events of Mar. and Oct., 1989 and Mar., 1991, following solar optical and X-ray flares, peculiar enhancements in the solar cosmic ray fluxes lasting for hours, in association with Geostationary Magnetopause Crossings (GMCs), were recorded by the particle detectors on board of GOES-7 satellite. On Oct.20, 1989, all three riometers installed at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz recorded an additional amount of cosmic noise absorption (CNA) superimposed to the main event, already in progress, caused by the energetic particles injected by the 4B flare of the previous day. Similar solar cosmic ray events were recorded by GOES-7 detectors on Mar. 24, 1991, and another, although of different in nature, on Mar. 13, 1989. These kind of events are interpreted as a result of continuous energetic particles injection at the flare site, which freely propagate along the magnetic field lines of the tangential discontinuity that is built between the solar mass ejecta and the disturbed solar wind. It is suggested that a noticeable "square wave" events can be more clearly observed by space detectors, out of the magnetosphere, during strong solar flares associated to coronal mass ejections

   83:  This work presents preliminary results of a comparison between numerical weather forecasts (NWF) of pressure fields operationally prepared by the U.S. National Meteorological Center (NMC) and by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) for the northern Antarctic Peninsula region during December/93 and January-February/94 with actual weather conditions from Chilean Navy hand-drawn charts of weather analysis. Also used were images of polar orbiting meteorological satellites, and data from surface observations at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz (EACF). Geographical locations and trajectories of low pressure centers and cold fronts In the NWF products In the 12 to 120 hours forecast range were the parameters used In the comparative study, since they are important in planning outdoor activities in the Antarctic Peninsula region. The results showed that for the twenty-one cases studied, only In three of them the NWFs gave a useful forecast, even considering the 12h range. Reasons for this low performance of the NmFs are indicated, in particular the lack of data in the southern austral oceans

Finally, this spectroscope will be operated over a frequency range of (2W - 2500) MHz. However. in high resolution mode it will be operating over a frequency range of (fs +- f), (f will be selected in the range of (50 - 500) MHz or as desirable), where fs. is the frequency selected in the entire range of band. At the same time, the entire frequency band will be monitored with low resolution made. Initial observations of this spectroscope at (1600 Ò 50) MHz, the details of spectroscope and future development plans (up to 1992) are presented

   83:  Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and plasma data are compared with ground-based geomagnetic Dst and AE indices to determine the causes of magnetic storms, substorms, and quiet during the descending phase of the solar cycle. In this paper we focus primarily on 1974 when the AE index is anomalously high (AE = 283 nT). This year is characterized by the presence of two long-lasting corotating streams associated with coronal holes. The corotating streams interact with the upstream low-velocity (300-350 km s-1), high-density heliospheric current sheet (HCS) plasma sheet, which leads to field compression and 15 to 25-nT hourly average values. Although the Bz component in this corotating interaction region (CIR) is often < - 10 nT, typically the field directionality is highly variable, and large southward components have durations less than 3 hours. Thus the corotating strean/HCS plasma sheet interaction region can cause recurring moderate (-100 nT:5 Dst... -50 nT) to weak (50 nT...Dst:5 -25 nT) storms, and sometimes no significant ring current activity at all (Dst > -25 nT). Storms of major (Dst... - 100 nT) intensities were not associated with CIRs. Solar wind energy is transferred to the magnetosphere via magnetic reconnection during the weak and moderate storms. Because the B, component in the interaction region is typically highly fluctuating, the corresponding storm main phase profile is highly irregular. Reverse shocks are sometimes present at the sunward edge of the CIR. Because these events cause sharp decreases in field magnitude, they can be responsible for storm recovery phase onsets. The initial phases of these corotating stream-related storms are caused by the increased ram pressure associated with the HCS plasma sheet and the further density enhancement from the stream-stream compression. Although the solar wind speed is generally low in this region of space, the densities can be well over an order of magnitude higher than the average value, leading to significant positive Dst values. Since there are typically no forward shocks at 1 AU associated with the stream-stream interactions, the initial phases have gradual onsets. The most dramatic geomagnetic response to the corotating streams are chains of consecutive substorms caused by the southward components of large-amplitude Alfven waves within the body of the corotating streams. This auroral activity has been previously named high-intensity long-duration continuous AE activity (HILDCAAs). The substorm activity is generally most intense near the peak speed of the stream where the Alfven wave amplitudes are greatest, and it decreases with decreasing wave amplitudes and stream speed. Each of the 27-day recurring HILDCAA events can last 10 days or more, and the presence of two events per solar rotation is the cause of the exceptionally high AE average for 1974 (higher than 1979). HILDCAAs often occur during the recovery phase of magnetic storms, and the fresh (and sporadic) injection of substorin energy leads to unusually long storm recovery phases as noted in Dst In the far trailing edge of the corotating stream, the IMF amplitudes become low, <3 nT, and there is an absence of large-amplitude fluctuations (Alfven waves). This is related to and causes geomagnetic quiet. There were three major (Dst... -100 nT) storms that occurred in 1974. Each was caused by a nonrecurring moderate speed stream led by a fast forward shock. The mechanisms for generating the intense interplanetary B, which were responsible for the subsequent intense magnetic storms was shock compression of preexisting southwardly directed Bz (Bs) for the two largest events and a magnetic cloud for the third (weakest) event. Each of the three streams occurred near a HCS crossing with no obvious solar optical or X ray signatures. It is speculated that these events may be associated with flux openings associated with coronal hole expansions. In conclusion, we present a model of geomagnetic activity during the descending phase of the solar cycle. It incorporates storm initial phases, main phases, HILDCAAs, and geomagnetic quiet. It uses some of the recent Ulysses results. We feel that this model is sufficiently developed that it may be used for predictions, and we encourage testing during the current Dhase of the solar cycle

   83:  MULTIFOT airglow photometer payload was launched from Alcantara (2.5 degrees S, 44.4 degrees W) on a SONDA III rocket at 23:52 hrs local time on 31 May 1992. A total of ten photometers, six forward-looking and four side-looking, measured the height profiles of the airglow emissions 02 Herzberg band system, 0I557.7 mn, NaD 589.3 mn, 0I630.0 mn, OH(8,3) band R branch at 724.0 nm, 02 Atmospheric (0,0) band at 762.0 nm and the sky background at 578 nm and 710 mn. At the time of launch, a ground-based airglow photometer observed the intensity variations of these emissions, together with the rotational temperature of the OH(9,4) band, and a sodium lidar measured atomic sodium concentration from 80 to 110 km

   83:  Nighttime atomic hydrogen and ozone concentrations are derived from simultaneous measurements ofthe vertical profiles of,upper mesospheric airglow emissions and atmospheric sodium. The airglow profiles were obtained in a sounding rocket experiment launched from Alcantara (2.5 degrees S, 44 degrees 2 degree W) on May 31, 1992. A lidar operating at the launch site was used to measure sodium at the time: of the rocket experiment. A total  10 airglow photometers, 6 forward looking and 4 side looking, observed the 0I557.7 nm, 02 Herzberg and 02 atmospheric (0,0) bands, sodium D lines, OI 630 mn, OH(8,3) band, and the airglow continuum. The simultaneous ground-based sodium lidar and onboard sodium airglow measuremetits made it possible to derive the ozone concentration at heights between 85 and 100 km. The hydrogen,concentrations were then calculated from the O2 atmosphere (0,0), OH (8,3) and the ozone profiles. The results suggest that the hydrogen concentration varied  1 x 10 cm-3 at 85 km to 1 x 10 8 cm-3 at 100 km, values much higher than those suggested by recent model atmospheres and by some rocket observations at middle and high latitudes. Although themethod of obtaining the concentrations of the minor constituents in the upper atmosphere is an indirect optical technique, this is the first time that these concentrations have been measured by rocket in the equatorial region

   83:  The equatorial ionosphere-thermosphere system (EITS) investigations during the STEP period (1990-1997) were focused on improving our understanding of the dynamic- and electrodynamic-coupling processes and energetics that govern the climatology of the system, as well as the variabilities of the system arising from forcing by magnetospheric and high latitude processes and by atmospheric waves from below. Thermosphere dynamics and dynamo electric fields serving as drivers of the coupling processes are responsible for the major EITS phenomena and their variabilities at different time scales. Especially, the day-to-day variabilities of the equatorial spread F (ESF) have received specific attention because of interest in space application areas as well. Significant advances were achieved in our understanding and representation of quiet and disturbed electric fields. The STEP period also marked notable improvement in the experimental diagnostic facilities available in the equatorial regions as well as in theoretical modeling of the interactive processes that control the major EITS phenomena. Data from coordinated observational campaigns have contributed to a better understanding of the EITS global responses to magnetospheric disturbances. The advances to be briefly discussed in this paper concern most of the major phenomena and the inherent characteristics of the EITS: the equatorial electric field and its sunset enhancement; thermospheric winds and temperature including the MTM (midnight temperature maximum); peculiar features of the ionosphere in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic equator; equatorial spread F/plasma bubble irregularities, including the energy requirement for large scale field aligned irregularities; equatorial anomalies in ion/neutral densities and temperatures. Also presented briefly is an overview of the results on the disturbance characteristics of the key EITS parameters and driving forces under magnetospheric disturbances and atmospheric wave forcing

   83:  Mais do que apresentar um relato cronologico da historia da instituiCao e,de seus fatos marcantes, a elaboracao do presente livro procurou levar em conta os aspectos determinantes de cada uma das fases do seu desenvolvimento. Para que o rigor historico fosse preservado, um longo trabalho de pesquisa foi conduzido sob a competente coordenaáao da nossa colega,jornalista Fabiola de Oliveira, que contou com a prestimosa colaboracao de muitos colegas, ex-funcionarios, e participantes da historia do INPE. Nao tenho duvidas de que este trabalho servira de referencia basica para qualquer obra de analise do desenvolvimento do programa espacial brasileiro e, em especial, do INPE. Da leitura atenta de cada um de seus capitulos, e na medida em que vamos virando as suas paginas, sentimos um desenrolar natural da historia, que pode ate mesmo transmitir a falsa impressao de que tudo foi feito de maneira suave. Na realidade, a historia do INPE e marcada por momentos de muitas dificuldades que so foram superados pelo enorme esforáo e dedicacao do seu corpo de funcionarios, quase uma obstinacao coletiva. E marcada tambem, felizmente, por inumeros momentos de reconhecimento nacional e internacional pelos bons resultados alcancados. A todos que trabalharam no INPE, aos que ainda hoje colaboram para o seu desenvolvimento, do mais humilde funcionario ao pesquisador mais qualificado, dedicamos esse livro. Acreditamos que o seu lancamento no ano em que a instituiáao completa 30 anos de fundacao e esta prestes a ter em orbita um de seus mais almejados objetivos - o primeiro satelite desenvolvido no Brasil - e mais do que oportuno

   83:  Ha cinco anos atras foi concluido o trabalho de levantamento historico do INPE, com o objetivo de resgatar os aq pectos determinantes de cada fase do seu desenvolvimento. Transformado no livro "Caminhos para o Espaco - 30 anos do INPE" o tabalho serve hoje de referencia para qualquer tarefa de analise do Programa Espacial Brasileiro e, em particular, do INPE. 0 presente livro da sequencia ao relato historico apresentado no livro anterior e teve como motivacao o lancamento em orbita, com sucesso, do nosso primeiro satelite - o SCID-1, em 09 de fevereiro de 1993. Inicialmente planejado para operar em orbita por cerca de um ano, o SCD-1 ja atinge a marca de tres anos de continua operacao e bons servicos de coleta de dados ambientais em todo territorio nacional. Esse resultado expressivo, que nao e comum na historia de outros paises que tambem chegaram ao espaco, e fruto da competencia desenvolvida no Pais no campo da engenharia espacial. Um bom projeto, testes exaustivos e controle em orbita cuidadoso transformaram o SCD-1 no maior sucesso da historia do INPE, orgulho de todos que, de alguma forma, contribuiram para isto. A confianca, adquirida com esse sucesso, abriu novos horizontes para o Programa Espacial Brasileiro, nas areas cientificas, tecnologicas e aplicadas. Varios novos objetivos, certamente mais ambidosos, foram tracados e alguns deles ja estarao se materializando no futuro proximo, com lancamentos de sateles mais complexos e voltados a outras necessidades do Pais. E o que veremos da leitura dos capitulos deste importante trabalho

   83:  MeThane (CH4) concentrations have been measured in the lower troposphere using in situ grab sampling, analysed a posteriori by gas chromatography. Data collected in the period 1993/1994/1995 in areas near Natal (60 degree S, 35 degree W), at the Atlantic coast and Cuiaba (16 degree S, 56 degree W), in the middle of the South American continent, show large differences in the marine/continental environments. Aircraft observations have produced vertical profiles in the biomass burning affected areas of central Brazil, in opposite seasons (wet and dry). Vertical profiles taken randomly in the affected area generally are well mixed, except if sources are nearby. The difference in the mixed average concentrations between wet and dry seasons is small but consistent, being of the order of tens of ppbv (parts per billion by volume)

   83:  The Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) Experiment in Alta Floresta, MT (09 degree 52 IS; 56 degree 06'w 288 m), was carried out during the dry and burning season in Amazonia, from 15-30 August, 1995, as part of a multidisciplinary study on mercury dispersion in the atmosphere. The field campaign consisted of five daily radiosoundings between 12 and 24 UTC, together with tethered baloon soundings up to 800 m, plus hourly surface meteorological observations from 09 to 23 UTC (local dawn to dusk time). For the meteorological analysis, satellite images and synoptic maps were also used. The region was under the influence of an anti-cyclone, which inhibited convection and the dispersion of particulates. The results show a normal dry season, with the occurrence of very low moisture levels and that pollutants, such as particulates and mercury originating from gold-mining ("garimpo") activities near Alta Floresta, may reach non-mining regions, such as Rondonia, during the calm dry season

   83:  A large measurement campaign took place in central Brazil in August-September of 1995 to observe trace gases and aerosols produced in biomass burning events. The SCAR-B (Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil) experiment was a collaboration between NASA and AEB/INPE. Measurements were made from the ground, and especially from different aircraft platforms. Important trace gases were measured, especially 03, CO, C02, N20, and CH4, plus UV-B radiation. The general conditions that prevailed in the meteorological conditions, air mass trajectodes, burning intensity and distribution in Brasil are discussed. In addition to the standard network of radiosoundings, 30 additional sondes were launched from Porto Nacional (12 degree S, 47 degree W), and thirty ozonesondes were launched from Cuiabci (16 degrre S, 56 degree W), between 15 August and 10 September

   83:  Large ozone concentrations were observed during the Brazilian/American field campaign SCAR-B (Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation- Brazil) in August-September 1995, in central Brazil. Ozone observations were made using UV absorption monitors on board of a Bandeirante aircraft. Flights were made near Porto Nacional (12 degree S, 47 degree W), Cuiabd (16 degree S, 56 degree W), and Alta Floresta (9.5 degree S, 56 degree W). Most ozone observations ranged from 35 to roughly 80 ppbv, in the August-September period, which are values comparable to previous in situ experiments in the Brazilian cerrado. In addition, horizontal aircraft flights have spotted special localized high ozone mixing ratios, above 100 and 120 ppbv near Cuiaba on two occasions, and twice near Alta Floresta. This is to be contrasted to wet season averages of roughly 15 Ò 5 ppbv. Surface observations during August and September at Natal (60 degree S, 35 degree W), which is located outside of the biomass burning area, show maximum ozone mixing ratios around 22 ppbv

   83:  Ozone concentrations have been measured in the lower and upper troposphere using ozonesondes launched from Cuiaba (6 degree S, 35 degree W). The data show that the largest ozone concentration variability occurs near the surface, where ozone mixing ratios vary between 20 and 80 ppbv. A total of 25 ozone profiles were obtained during the SCAR-B mission, between August 16 and September 10, 1995. A strong ozone peak is observed August 26,27 and 29 near 3-4 km, which develops to a very high concentration of 140 ppbv. Trajectory analyses show the origin of these enhancements, and photochemical calculations are made to investigate this extreme ozone formation

   83:  Aerosols from biomass burning sources in the tropical regions of the globe play a significant role in the earth's energy balance (IPCC, 1994). Recent model studies incorporating sulfate aerosols demonstrate that the direct aerosol forcing, in part, counters warming by greenhouse gases over the industrial regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Mitchell et al., 1995). These models do not include biomass burning aerosol, but the observed extent, duration and concentration of biomass burning aerosols suggest that the direct effect of these aerosols on global climate may be of the same magnitude as the sulfate aerosol of northern mid-latitudes. In addition because of their hygroscopicity, biomass burning aerosol acting as cloud condensation nuclei may play a significant role in modifying cloud properties and affecting the energy balance indirectly (Twomey, 1984, Kaufman and Nakajima, 1993)

   83:  On August 31 and September 2, 1996, backscattersondes were launched from Cuiaba, Brazil (16 degree S, 56 degree W) during an intense agricultural burning period. The instrumentation employed senses the aerosol backscatter at two wavelengths (490 and 940 nm) as well as the ozone concentration, relative humidity, air temperature and pressure with a vertical resolution of about 25 m. The primary objective was to evaluate the potential of the instrument for biomass burning studies, both as a supplement to more comprehensive measurements from aircraft, and as a stand alone technique in the absence of any extensive field campaign. It was also anticipated that the results may illuminate proposed processes in which the lower altitude air penetrates the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and is transported into the free troposphere. on both soundings an abrupt, two order of magnitude drop in the aerosol backscatter was observed at the precise altitude of the PBL top (about 5 km). The ozone mixing ratio also shows a drop from 90 ppbv at the top of the PBL to 40 ppbv a few kilometers higher, with the decrease being more gradual than in the case of the aerosol. Also in both soundings small layers of enhanced ozone, water vapor and aerosol backscatter were observed above the PBL in air significantly dryer than that found in the PBL, but not as dry as that found at higher altitudes. Values of the aerosol to ozone ratio and relative humidity in these layers are not consistent with simple conservative transport from the PBL to the free troposphere and

   83:  Ozone soundings at Cuiaba were made during two biomass burning field campaigns: SCAR-B (Smoke, Clouds, Aerosols, Radiation - Brazil) in August-Sept. 195 and TRACEA (Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator Atlantic) in September-October 1992). Characteristics of these soundings are summarized by Kirchhoff et al [TRACEA 1996a; SCAR-B, 1996b]. The ozone records are compared in terms of mean mixing ratios at each altitude. "Excess ozone," defined as the amount above a climatological, non-burning season ozone profile, is also determined. The magnitude and variability of ozone is explored with respect to AVHRR-derived biomass fire counts available for each year. Trajectories are used to determine the likely origin of high tropospheric ozone layers (60-120 ppbv) observed in the soundings below 5 km. Tropospheric column ozone was slightly higher during SCAR-B Am TRACEA with all of the difference below 5 km. Transport patterns were not very different for the two experiments, but vegetation fires are more numerous during SCAR-B than TRACE-A. In the upper troposphere the origin of excess ozone is presumed to be deep convective injection of pollution products (CO, NOx,hydrocarbons) that react to produce ozone

   83:  The monthly and daily samples of the Ap geornagnetic index for 51 years, in the 1932-1982 interval, were investigated by means of the power spectrum technique. Although in general the results confirm previous findings about possible periodicities in the geomagnetic activity, some aspects are either new or they are now interpreted somewhat differently than other authors have done. The period around 4 years in the monthly Ap power spectrum is associated to the dual peak-structure observed in the geomagnetic activity variation (Gonzalez et al., 1990). Several of the peaks shown by the daily Ap spectrum are interpreted as harmonics of the six-month period, and others as caused by the solar rotation periodicity, in such a way that the two series of Fourier sequences are considered to be juxtaposed. A strong solar cycle modulation is observed in these series, particularly in that related to the solar rotation period, which almost disappears for the solar maximum phase. Furthermore, a statistic analysis of the geomagnetic storm occurrence has confirmed the findings related to the dualpeak distribution as well to the seasonal variation

   83:  During the interval of August 1978 - December 1979, 56 unambiguous fast forward shocks were identified using magnetic field and plasma data collected by the ISEE-3 spacecraft. Because this interval is at a solar maximum we assume the streams causing these shocks are associated with coronal mass ejections and eruptive solar flares. For these shocks we shall describe the shock- storm relationship for the level of intense storms (Dst < -100 nT). Then, we will discuss the interplanetary structures that are associated with the large-amplitude and long-duration negative B, fields,which are found in the sheath field and/or driver gas regions of the shock and are thought to be the main cause of the intense storms. We will also present for the solar physicist a summary of the interplanetary/magnetosphere coupling functions, based on the magnetopause reconnection process. We will end by giving an overview of the long-term evolution of geornagnetic storms such as those associated with the seasonal and solar cyle distributions

   83:  Simultaneous measurements of the atomic oxygen nightglow emissions at 777.4 nm and 630.0 nm have been used in the past few years to determine the ionospheric F-layer peak electron density and peak height, and to investigate the pattern of F-layer depleted plasma regions, or ionospheric transequatorial plasma bubbles, and their associated irregularities In the tropical ionosphere. Meridional scanning observations of these emissions at low latitudes are presented, in the form of computer generated three-dimensional perspective views, showing the spatial north-south and temporal intensity variations of the 0I emissions, for both normal conditions and in the presence of magnetic field-aligned large scale plasma irregularities or bubbles. Significant features of these observations are discussed. This remote sensing airglow techniq"e is very useful to study ionospheric plasma dynamical processes and to investigate the pattern of large scale plasma irregularities in the nighttime tropical ionosphere

Um pouco da historia da aproximacao do Brasil a China, no setor de Ciencia e Tecnologia, indica que o primeiro esforáo de cooperacao entre os paises traduziu-se atraves do Acordo Quadro em Ciencia e Tecnologia, assinado em marco de 1982. Dois anos apos, em maio de 1984, os Governos brasileiro e chines assinaram o primeiro Protocolo Suplementar ao Acordo de 1982, declarando a intencao de intensificar a cooperacao e elegendo areas prioritarias, entre as quais incluiram a espacial

   83:  In this letter, we have investigated the effect of energetic electron precipitation at the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly on the local mesospheric ozone concentration. In the mesosphere. the ionization produced by precipitation acts as a source of odd hydrogen. Since odd hydrogen processes dominate ozone destruction in this region, a decrease in the ozone concentration should be expected during these events. Based on a simple photochemical equilibrium model. it is estimated that at large solar zenith angles the ozone concentration between about 70 and 80 km altitude in the anomaly region can be considerably depleted mainly during large geomagnetic storms

   83:  The westward drift of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA) has long been known. Recent computations based on an eccentric geomagnetic dipole, as compared with archeomagnetic data obtained in South America, seem to indicate that the SAMA region has a periodic movement around the Earth with a period of about 2300 years. We think that this evidence may contribute to a better understanding of the complex physical processes occurring in the Earth's liquid core, where the magnetic field originates

   83:  The nightglow OH(9,4) and 02 atmospheric (0,1) band emission intensities and their rotational temperatures T(OH) and 2), respectively, observed at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degree S, 45 degree W), Brazil, during the period from October 1989 to December 1990, have been analyzed to study the nighttime mesospheric energy loss rates through the radiations from the vibrationally excited OH* and electronically excited 0*2 bands. The total emission rates of the OH Meinel bands, 02 atmospheric (0,0) and 02 infrared atmospheric ... bands were calculated using reported data for the relative band intensities I(...)/I(9,4)I02A(0.0)/I02A(0.10) and. IO2(...)/IO2A(0.1). It was found that there is a minimum in equivalent energy loss rate by the OH Meinel bands during December/January (equivalent energy loss rate of 0.39K/day*, when day* means averaged over the night) and maximum in equivalent energy loss rate during September (equivalent energy loss rate of 0.98K/day*). Energy loss rate by the 0*2 radiation, on the other hand, is weaker than that by the OH* Meinel bands, showing equivalent energy loss rates of 0. 12 K/day* and 0.22 K/day during January and September, respectively

   83:  We treat the global-scale modelling and measurement activities of the SUNDIAL campaign of September 1986 and investigate averaged, quiet-time, and dynamic ionospheric behavior. Treament is given to developments in empirical and first-principle models; and we investigate various aspects of magnetosphericthermospheric-ionospheric coupling mechanisms. Overall results point to good empirical model specification of averaged F-region behavior, with suggestions for improvements in specification of layer peak densities near and across the sunset terminator. We elucidate the difficulties in achieving a unique determination of electric fields, thermospheric winds, and plasmaspheric fluxes in first-principle model attempts to reproduce global observations of quiet-time F-region heights and densities. In this connection, and in our treatment of magnetospherically-imposed electric field influences on low-latitude F-region dynamics, we show a greater need for comprehensive measurements of auroral oval dynamics, thermospheric winds, electric fields, ion coiposi6on, and ionospheric layer heights and densities; and we discuss the growing importance of the lower regions of the ionosphere and thermosphere and the associated controls of dynamo-driven electric fields

   83:  Frequency range of existing narrow band (1.6 Ò 0.1) GHz high sensitivity digital spectroscope is extended to (0.2 - 2.5) GHz in conjunction with a 9-meter diameter polar mounted antenna. This spectroscope will be recording two circular polarizations almost simultaneously. Normally two spectroscopes will be operated simultaneously in the frequency ranges of (0.2 - 1.0) GHz and (1.O - 2.5) GhZ with time resolution of 100 ms. However, flexibility of each receiver independently will permit us to select the desired band of observation and frequency and time resolutions. This is the major advantage of this system over similar ones operating in the world. Digital HP8595E spectrum analyser will be used in the frequency range of (1.0 - 2.5) GHz as variable frequency radiometer which will enable us to change time and frequency resolution quickly. Also, necessary hardware and software developed by HP will be used in conjunction with spectrum analyser, in order to digitize 200 frequency channels with desired resolutions. Data will be stored in PC486 and also will be tranfered to "SUN Station" in real time. Following details of the instrumentation are presented here: i) field tests of the "front end" including wide band (0.2 - 2.5) GHz antenna, low noise pre-amplifiers, and polarization switches; ii) typical example of the solar microwave type III burst analysed using software that will be used in the broad band system

   83:  The MULTIFOT airglow payload included 4 side-looking instruments which measured the OH(8,3) band and Na D line emissions. For much of the rocket flight the photometers were well above tile emission layers, so that the 4 rps rotation of the rocket payload resulted in a raster scan of the emission layers by the fields of view of the side-looking photometers. The combined effects of the mean vehicle motion, payload rotation, and coning, resulted in the scanning of an area more than 600 km in the N-S direction and 800 km in the N-S direction. The airglow intensities show horizontal variations by as much as a factor of two. In the case of the OH emission a localised area of enhanced emission involved an increase in intensity of around 50
   83:   over a horizontal distance of only 20 km. The observed horizontal variations do not appear to be associated with gravity wave propagation

   83:  Over the past few years measurement of the thermal broadening of lidar returns from the atmospheric sodium layer has become a practical technique for monitoring temperature between 80 and 105 km. The method, first demonstrated more than 15 years ago, has now reached the point where it provides the best accuracy, time and height resolution of any technique for the relevant height interval. The principal drawback to the method, as implemented at present, is the high cost of the laser equipment needed to produce the highly stable narrow line-width emission required to measure the hyperfine structure of the sodium resonance. This paper presents a new technique, using a comb laser, which makes it possible to determine the Doppler temperature of the lidar signal with only small modifications to a lidar not originally designed to measure temperature, thus reducing the cost by more than an order of magnitude

   83:  A balloon experiment conducted on December 20, 1994, in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region, detected events with increases in x-ray flux due to electron precipitation coincident with a mild substorm activity. For the first time in the SAA, the analysis of the x-ray Flux associated with the electron precipitation and the geomagnetic H-field component showed simultaneous Pc4 pulsations at periods in the range 95 to 100s. Analysis of a prominent precipitation event of this Right showed direct correlation between the pulsation strength in the x-ray and in the magnetic data and are related to the intensity of the precipitation. While the substorm associated electric fields and currents in the ionosphere can induce amplification of Pc 4 pulsations, the x-ray pulsations due to electron precipitation may be related to wave modulated pitch angle scatterings

   83:  A relatively strong stratospheric column ozone decrease was observed inithe south of Brazil (29.5 degree S) in 1993, at the end of October. This ozone decrease was observed when the normal behavior of the ozone column at low latitudes, in Brazil, reaches its yearly maximum, so that a decrease of ozone during this time period is unexpected. The local observations were made by two different measurement techniques. Two independent ground-based Brewer spectrophotometers documented strong column ozone decreases in the south of Brazil, in 1993. The vertical distribution of ozone was observed with ozone-soundings, showing a uniform ozone decrease at all heights in the stratosphere, and very low ozone in the lower stratosphere, which has been shown to be a characteristic of Antarctic ozone in Spring. TOMS ozone data, representing a third observational technique, averaged over small latitude-longitude bands, correlate very well with the local observations, which leaves no doubt that the observed ozone decreases in the south of Brazil during October 1993 were real. Also, the observed ozone decreases may be considered large, since for comparison, the local seasonal variation is at most of the order of 30 Dobson Units (DU), whereas one of the October decreases measured about 60 DU. There seems to be no physical or chemical mechanism at low latitudes, that could account for such a large and fast perturbation in the stratosphere. On the other hand, inspection of the TOMS total ozone data maps, on the days of the above observations, show a distinct link between the Antarctic ozone hole latitudes, reachingout to the north in a curved path, and touching tropical latitudes over a narrow belt. Trajectory analyses confirm that for days of low ozone in Santa Maria, Brazil, the air masses at 20 and 25 km height have an Antarctic origin

   83:  For the first time, solar bursts in the frequency range of (18-23) GHz have been observed with high-time (0.6-1.2 s) and high-frequency resolution (I GHz), by using the Itapetinga 13.7 m diameter antenna. Here, we investigate the microwave type "simple low level (<10 SFU) bursts" associated with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Observed properties of these simple bursts are: rise time tr  3 s, decay time td 5 s and spectral index ranging between - 1 and -4. These bursts were found to be associated with SF or SN flares as seen in Ha. The above properties suggest that they are likely to be a microwave counterpart of elementary flare bursts. In the majority of the cases the spectral evolution is soft-hard-soft. This suggests a nonthermal gyrosynchrotron mechanism for generating these elementary flare bursts. Estimated parameters of these simple burst sources are height (h - 2400 km), electron density (N, < 8.8 X 10 9 cm-3 ), and magnetic field (B 300 G)

   83:  We present 20 new eclipse timings for V4140 Sgr (NSV 12615). The analysis of this data together with 25 timings obtained earlier by Baptista et al. ( 1989, MNRAS, 241, 63 1) indicates that the orbital period is not constant. The inclusion of a nonlinear term in the ephemeris to predict the times of minimum is significant at a 3-  level, either considering a quadratic or a sinusoidal behavior versus time. If the quadratic fit is the correct one, the system is increasing its orbital period in a time scale of 1.2 X 10 7 years, with a mass transfer rate of... The corresponding orbital period derivative (P) is very similar to the one earlier determined for Z Cha (Wood et al. 1986, MNRAS, 219, 629). If the sinusoidal fit is correct, the system presents a cycle of 5.4 years, which may be explained in terms of a magnetic activity cycle in the secondary star. The observed orbital period variations cannot be explained as a result of either apsidal motion or orbital motion around a third body

   83:   in blue light and were observed in 10 different observing sessions during 1996 April-August using a CCD photometer at the 1.6 m and 0.6 m telescopes of Laboratorio Nacional de Astrofisica, in Brazil. The pulsations were also observed with the UBVRI fast photometer. With only one exception, the observed optical periods are consistent with those observed by the BATSE instrument on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory at the same epoch. There is a definite correlation between the observability of pulsations and the optical brightness of the system: V2116 Oph had R magnitude in the range 15.3-15.5 when the pulsed signal was detected, and R = 16.9-17.7 when no pulsations were present The dicovery makes GX 1+4 only the third of about 40 accretion-powered X-ray pulsars to be firmly detected as a pulsating source in the optical. The presence of flickering and pulsations in V2116 Oph adds strong evidence for an accretion disk scenario in this system. The absolute magnitude of the pulsed component on 1996 May 27 is estimated to be My ~ -1.5. The implied dimensions for the emitting region are 1.1 R, 3.2 R, and 7.0 R, for blackbody spectral distributions with T 10-5 K, 2 X 10-4 K, and 1 X 10-4 K, respectively

   83:  In the course of an extensive campaign to measure radial velocities of galaxies in a selected sample of compact groups photometrically studied by de Carvalho et al., we report the discovery of a system very rich in starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei. This is the system HCG 16 of Hickson's catalog of compact groups. The seven brightest galaxies form a kinematical group with biweighted estimate mean velocity of Vbi=3959 Ò 66 km s-1, dispersion bi = 86 Ò 55 km s-1, a median radius (R) = 0.197 Mpc, a mean density of (D) = 217 galaxies Mpc-3, and a total absolute magnitude of MB = -22.1. From their spectral characteristics, we have identified one Seyfert 2 galaxy, two LINERs, and three starburst galaxies. Thus, HCG 16 appears to be a dense concentration of active galaxies. In our sample of 17 Hickson groups, HCG 16 is unique in this regard, which suggests that it is an uncommon structure in the nearby universe

These changes in shape always determine the direction of the incoming wave and may provide information on the wave's polarization. We present a new approach for determining the position of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves which involves fewer calculations than in earlier methods. We also show how the measured quantities relate to the energy density of the wave

   83:  In the course of the Pico dos Dias survey (PDS), we identified the stellar-like object PDS 456 at coordinates = 17h28m19s796  = -14 degrees15'55".87 (epoch 2000), with a relatively nearby (z = 0.184) and bright (B = 14.69) quasar. Its position at Galactic coordinates l= 10 degrees 4, b = + 11 degrees 2, near the bulge of the Galaxy, may explain why it was not detected before. The optical spectrum of PDS 456 is typical of a luminous quasar, showing a broad (FWHM  4000 km s-1) H  line, very intense Fe II lines, and a weak [0 III] 5007 line. PDS 456 is associated to the infrared source IRAS 17254-1413 with a 60  infrared luminosity L60 = 3.8 x 10 45 ergs s-1. The relatively flat slopes in the infrared [ (25, 60) = -0.33 and  (12, 25) = -0.78] and a flat power index in the optical (Fv  oc v-0.72) may indicate a low dust content. A good match between the position of PDS 456 and the position of the X-ray source RXS J172819.3-141600 implies an X-ray luminosity Lx = 2.8 x 10 44 ergs s-1. The good correlation between the strength of the emission lines in the optical and the X-ray luminosity, as well as the steep optical to X-ray index estimated ( ox = - 1.64), suggests that PDS 456 is radio quiet. A radio survey previously performed in this region yields an upper limit for radio power at about 5 GHz of approximately 2.6 x 10 30 ergs-1 Hz-1. We estimate the Galactic reddening in this line of sight to be Ab  2.0, implying an absolute magnitude Mb = -26.7 (using H0 = 75 km s-1 Mpc-1 and qo = 0). In the optical, PDS 456 is therefore 1.3 times more luminous than 3C 273 and the most luminous quasar in the nearby (z  0.3) universe

   83:  Optical and near infrared spectroscopy of the stars DQ Ser and DT Ser are presented. DQ Ser shows a late-type continuum (M3 - M5) with emission lines of Balmer series, Hel, Hell, [0III], 0I and CaII triplet while DT Ser presents a earlier spectral type with emission of Balmer lines, HeI, HeII and [0III]. DT Ser is a faint V = 15.4 star 5 arcsec from a V = 12.8 G companion. We suggest it to be a yellow symbiotic star

   83:  The first simultaneous ground-based observations of permitted atomic oxygen OI 777.4 nm emission line and the forbidden 0I 630.0 and 557.7nm emission lines have been carried out from  Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degree S 45.0 degree W) and Fortaleza (39 degree, 38.4 degree W), Brazil, during the period November 1986-March 1988. In addition, N+2 391.4 nm emission observations have hen carried out at Cachoeira Paulista during the same period. At both stations ionosonde measurements are carried out on a routine basis. These simultaneous multispectral optical and ionospheric measurements have made possible studies on the response of the equatorial and low - latitude ionospheric F region to magnetic storm. A comparison of the observations obtained during magnetically quiet and disturbed conditions shows that the nocturnal intensity variations of the atomic oxygen emissions observed are well correlated with the variations of the F- region parameters (foF2 and h'F), showing the dominant role played by the enhanced F-region dynamical processes during disturbed period, possibly induced by substorm-associated electric fields and disturbed neutral winds in the low-latitude F-regionWhile the N+2 emission is enhanced in disturbed periods, as expected from energetic neutral particle precipitation, any enhancements in the atomic oxygen emissions were not detectable against the airglow due to recombination processes

   83:  In this work the onset of the night-to-day phase transition in VLF signals, transmitted from Golfo Nuevo, Argentina (43 degree S, 65 degree W) and received at Atibaia, SP (23 degree S, 46 degree W), are studied in conjunction with ozone data from a Dobson spectrophotometer operated at Cachocira Paulista, SP (22 degree S, 45 degree W), for the years 1977-1979. Meaningful values of the cross-correlation coefficients for trends of significant number of days, after eliminating the annual variation time series in both sets of data, have been obtained. The superposition of the lag-times of the correlation found for each year reveals a semi-annual variation, which may indicate a meridional transport of ozone in the mesosphere assuming a significant role of the 03 molecules in the solar UV absorption and perhaps indirectly in the negative ion chemistry of the ionospheric D-region

   83:  Night-time thermospheric temperatures, T630, and mesospheric rotational temperatures, T(OH) and T(02), have been measured at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degreeS, 45 degreeW, 16 degree S dip latitude), located in both the equatorial ionospheric anomaly and the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly, with a Fabry-Perot interferometer and a multi-channel tilting filter-type photometer, respectively. The thermospheric temperatures are obtained from the Doppler line broadening of the 0I 630.0 nm emission and the mesospheric rotational temperatures from the OH(9,4) and O2A(O, 1) band emissions. Measurements made during three geomagnetic storms showed that the nocturnal mean values of T630 during the recovery phase of the storms were lower than those observed during quiet time and from model predictions. Also, the nocturnal mean value of the T630 soon after the SSC event on 27 June 1992 was higher than the quiet time and model predictions. The observed mesospheric nocturnal mean rotational temperatures, T(OH) and T(02), were unaffected by the storms, A comparison of the night-time observed temperatures T630, T(OH) and T(02) with those calculated using the MSIS-86 model is also presented

   83:  Low-latitude plasma drifts (zonal and meridional) in the F-region are inferred from the observed night-time thermospheric neutral wind velocities and temperature gradients, together with models for the neutral density (MSIS-86 model) and the electron density (IRI model). The thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures are derived from measurements of Doppler shifts and widths of the 01630.0 nm airglow emission line, respectively, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degree S, 45 degree W), Brazil. The equations considered are the ideal gas law and the momentum equation for the thermosphere, which includes the time variation of the neutral wind, the pressure gradient which is related to the temperature and density gradients and the ion drag force. The present method to infer the night-time plasma drift using observed neutral parameters (6me variation of neutral wind velocities and temperature gradient) showed results 29 am in reasonable agreement with our calculated plasma drifts and those observed in other low-latitude locations. On the other hand, it is surprising that sometimes the winds flow from the observed coldest sector to the hottest part of the thermosphere during many hours, suggesting that plasma drift can drive the neutral winds at low latitudes for a period of time

   83:  Simultaneous measurements of the nightglow profiles of the 02 Herzberg I bands, the 02 Atmospheric (0-0) band and the atomic oxygen green line, carried out at Alcantara (2.3 degree S; 44.4 degree W), are presented and discussed. This is the first measurement of the vertical profile of the Herzberg I band to be carried out at equatorial latitudes. The atomic oxygen concentration derived from the 02 Atmospheric (0-0) band emission profile is used to test a photochemical scheme to explain the measured 02... nightglow emission based on atomic oxygen recombination. The kinetic analysis is carried out assuming the emission ratio Herzberg 1: Herzberg II = 5:1, 10:1 and the extreme case where Herzberg II brightness = 0. For all three cases studied, the quenching rates required to explain the measurements are higher than the values derived from previous airglow measurements

   83:  The Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 were some of the largest of this century. In addition causing devastating local effects, they injected large quantities of particles and gases, especially sulfur dioxide, SO2, straight into the middle atmosphere. In this paper we present and discuss simultaneous observations of stratospheric O3 and SO2 carried out at Cuiaba (16.0 degrees S, 500 degrees W), Brazil, where an automated Brewer spectrophotometer is operated on a routine basis. The data. presented cover both the pre- and post-eruption conditions (October 1990-August 1994). Also, some complementary total ozone observations carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W) and Natal(5.8 degree S, 35.2 degrees W) in Brazil have been used in this report. After about two wo major eruption (early July), a strong enhancement (factor of six) in the column SO2 observations was detected at Cuiaba. The enhanced SO2 levels continued two and half months. The total ozone observations at Cuiaba showed a significant (11
   83:  ) decrease in the stratospheric ozone levels during the winter months in 1992, possibly associated in part with delayed volcanic injection effects in the stratosphere

   83:  Simultaneous rocket measurements of the OH Meinel (8-3) band and 02 Atmospheric (0-0) band emission profiles are used to investigate the OH (v = 8) loss in the equatorial mesosphere due to collisions with 02 and N2. The 02 Atmospheric (0-0) band emission profile is used to obtain the atomic oxygen concentration. The derived branching ratios, A(8)/A(8-3), and quenching parameters are found to be about a factor of two smaller than those obtained by McDade et al. (1987). Adopting branching ratios A(8)A(8-3)from the literature, the best agreement between the emission profiles of oxygen and OH is obtained using the Meinel band transition probabilities of Turnbull and Lowe (1989)

   83:  Simultaneous observations of the 0I 630.O nm nightglow emission using an all-sky imaging system, and thermospheric winds and temperatures using a Fabry-Perot interferometer at 630.0 nm, have been recently conducted at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 S. 45.0 W, dip latitude 15,8'S). The all-sky imaging observations of the 0I 630.O nm nightglow emission, which arises from the 0+2 ionospheric dissociative recombination process are used to monitor the morphology and dynamics of transequatorial ionospheric plasma bubbles in the height range of the nightglow emissions. In this paper we present simultaneous observations from these two instruments obtained in April and August 1991, in which some nights showed the presence of ionospheric plasma bubbles. These observations are also complemented by ionospheric sounding data obtained at the equatorial station Fortaleza (3.9 S, 38.4 W, dip latitude 3.7 S). Significant features of the morphology and time evolution of the plasma depletions as seen through the 0I 630.0 nm emission images and possible influence of the thermospheric winds on the generation of the plasma irregularities are analyzed and discussed

   83:   Observations of the 0H(8-3) band rotational temperature have been carried out from Calgary (51 N. 114 W). Canada. from 1988 to 1990. The measurements have been taken in orthogonal scanning mode and the data set has been analyzed to study salient features of gravity waves in the mesospheric region from this mid-latitude station. Rotational temperature data from 36 nights showed distinct gravity wave activity during this period. The gravity wave characteristics studied include the dominant period. horizontal structure speed. implied horizontal wavelength and horizontal component of direction of propagation. The preferred direction in the horizontal wave propagation at Calgary is towards the northwest. A comparison of the observed horizontal propagation directions with the permitted directions, using model wind profiles for Calgary. shows good agreement. This indicates that the upward flow of wave energy could be modified by the background wind

   83:  Atmospheric X-rays in the energy range from 30 to 150 keV were measured in the Southern hemisphere extending from 53 to 81 degrees magnetic latitude during two long-duration balloon flights. The measurements were obtained during the Extended Life Balloon Borne Observatories (ELBBO) experiment. The experiment consisted of five superpressure balloon flights launched from Dunedin, New Zealand, in November and December 1992. The ELBBO X-ray data can be considered the longest continuous data set ever obtained in the Southern Hemisphere, and extend over 30 degrees of magnetic latitude previously unmeasured. The X-ray measurements are compared to similar data obtained in the past by several groups in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, as well as with available model results. Most ELBBO results confirm earlier findings about the flux and spectra of atmospheric X-rays and are in general agreement with model results for higher energies. However, they indicate that the X-ray flux in the Southern hemisphere is almost constant from high latitudes up to 30 magnetic degrees, in contrast to the model results that indicate a drop off around 50 magnetic degrees. Whether such discrepancy should be attributed to the different energies involved or to the presence of the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly is a point that remains to be investigated

   83:  We present here a brief review of recent results related to the response of the major phenomena of the equatorial ionosphere-thermosphere system (EITS) to magnetospheric disturbances. Modifications to the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), equatorial spread F (ESF) and equatorial electrojet (EEJ) are produced by (a) disturbance electric fields resulting from prompt equatorward penetration of magnetospheric/high latitude electric fields, (b) disturbance dynamo driven by enhanced global thermospheric circulation resulting from energy input at high latitude, and (c) disturbance winds (zonal and meridional) modifying the equatorial thermospheric dynamics. While the disturbance electric fields could cause enhanced development or inhibition of these phenomena the disturbance winds seem to always inhibit them, especially the EIA and ESF. New results discussed concern the role of meridional winds in the disturbance electric field induced F layer height response over low latitudes, evidence on ESF/plasma bubble inhibition by disturbance meridional/trans-equatorial wind, EIA expansion in latitude reaching spectacular magnitude during intense storms, longitudinal/local time dependence of EIA enhancements; and common sources of ESF and EIA response features and related aspects, among others, We advance, further, suggestions on specific studies to be pursued for better understanding of the problems presented

We have cross-checked these large data sets and report here on one night of active spread-F with good data from both San Marco 5 and Cachoeira Paulista. As expected, a correlation is observed between airglow bubbles and ion density depletions encountered by San Marco 5. Additional airglow bubbles can be linked to enhanced AC electric field fluctuations, similar to those previously suspected to characterize satellite passes through pinched off spread-F bubbles. These data complement existing airglow-satellite correlations made in other longitude sectors and provide information relevant to the interpretation of satellite and airglow data

   83:  A new analysis of atmospheric sodium measurements, made at Sao Jose dos Campos (23 degree S, 46 degree W) since 1972, confirms the previously detected trend in the centroid height of the layer (near 92km altitude) and shows the existence of a 10-yr solar-cycle related oscillation. The centroid height fell at an average rate of 37Ò9myr-1 between 1972 and 1994, and the 10-yr cyclehas an amplitude of 170Ò 110m. An analysis of the vertical distribution of atmospheric sodium shows that the fall in height of the centroid is not caused by a simple vertical displacement of the sodium profile, but by the growth of a bulge on the bottomside of the layer

   83:  We report photometric southern hemisphere wintertime perturbations of the nocturnal F-region atomic oxygen 630 nm red line intensity which are observed to occur concurrently with apparent ionogram signatures of F-region gravity waves. Such airglow events were detected on a total of 40 days of experiments. The airglow experiments were run at Cachoeira Paulista (CP, geographic 22 degree 41' S, 45 degree 00'W, dip 28 degree S). The events are characterized by south-to-north travelling airglow valleys, or depletion events (SNE). They were obtained from a set of 299 experiments performed during the period of 10 August 1977 to 4 July 1984. Their equatorwards velocities, wavelengths and periods vary within the ranges of 150-300ms-1, 100-200 km and 15 min - 3 h, respectively. They appear during the post-sunset period and remain within the field of view of the meridional scanning photometer from about ten minutes to a few hours. The SNE were seen to occur more frequently in July and were absent from September to March. The photometer scanned Ò 75 degree around zenith in the magnetic meridional and zonal planes. ionogram. spread-F and VHF polarimeter data that showed no phase or amplitude scintillations during the SNE indicated no concurrent existence of equatorial plasma depletions. It is shown that the SNE are not necessarily related to geomagnetic disturbed conditions. The present results are, to the authors' knowledge, the first showing gravity wave effects, near the sunset side of the solar terminator, on the low-latitude F-region atomic oxygen red nightglow under undisturbed geomagnetic conditions. The characteristics of these waves point to the solar terminator as their source of generation. A series of physical and morphological features of the phenomena are presented

   83:  For the first time, direct peak-current measurements with an instrumented tower of 27 negative downward lightning flashes were obtained at latitudes below 25'. The measurements were carried out in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil (geographic latitude 20'S) from 1985 to 1995. The medians of the peak current for the first and subsequent strokes are compared with the values obtained in other locations. The comparison suggests that the first-stroke peak current of negative flashes tends to increase (when moving from high latitudes) towards 30 degrees of geographic latitude, and then remains approximately constant to the equator. The peak current of the subsequent strokes, in turn, seems not to be related to latitude

   83:  An encounter of the earth with a high velocity solar wind stream triggered the magnetic storm of 29 January 1995. The storm lasted for the following seven days, keeping the level of the Dst index in the range of - 25- - 50 nT. At the dip-equator, a regular enhancement of the magnetic H component during daytime, referred to as the Equatorial Electrojet (EEJ), was seen to be suppressed and modified during this storm interval. We attempted to classify the type of the EEJ modification by analyzing magnetometer data from two stations at the dip-equator but located in the opposite hemisphere, and energetic particle data from two geosynchronous satellites located close to the ground magnetometer meridian. As a result, three different types of modulation of EEJ amplitudes, with time scales of 15 min to 1 day, were found to appear during the periods when the flux level of low energy charged particles (>30 keV) in the midnight magnetosphere was increased above the quiet level. These modulations were characterized by referring to the nightside particle signatures. We argue that, although the EEJ is a local enhancement of the ionospheric currents at the dayside dip-equator, the EEJ is definitely affected by changes of the magnetosphere, probably in various ways arising from the complexities of the storm effects.

   83:  Nighttime themospheric neutral winds and temperatures are derived from measurements of Doppler shifts and widths of the 0I 630.0 nm airglow emission line, respectively, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degree S, 45 degree W, 16 degree S dip latitude), Brazil. The observed nighttime East-West and North-South temperature gradients and neutral wind velocity variations are presented for two geomagnetic storm periods 7-10 July 1991 and 4-9 August 1991. Zonal plasma drifts inferred during an intense geomagnetic storm, from the nighttime neutral wind velocities and temporal temperature gradient variations, suggested that a strong zonal plasma drift (-240 m/s) on 9-10 July 1991 changed the direction of the zonal winds to westward at 01:30. Also A was noticed that, during the geomagnetic storm, the zonal temperature gradients were not well defined like those observed during quiet time. The meridional wind was towards the pole for the whole night during the geomagnetic storm of 9-10 July, a behaviour which is unusual during winter time (southern hemisphere) at Cachoeira Paulista. However, the meridional plasma drifts inferred did not show significant differences during the quiet and disturbed periods. The method presented to infer plasma drifts using the observed neutral parameters showed results comparable with those observed by incoherent scatter radar measurements at Arecibo

Horizontal structures in the OH emission intensity and rotational temperature were monitored optically, together with the background wind and its wave induced fluctuations, measured by MU radar. A total of 5 nights among the 7 nights of useful data showed wavelike oscillations in both the emission intensity and temperature. Good agreement was found between individual wave parameters-intrinsic period, phase velocity, horizontal and vertical wavelength- obtained from the radar and optical techniques. On some occasions a short period (3 h) gravity wave was observed to propagate, superposed on a long period (9 h) wave

   83:  Lidar measurements of upper atmospheric sodium were made at Alcantara (2 degree 20' S, 44 degree 30' W), Brazil, on 8 days during the month of November 1996. These are be ho sodium measurements to be reported from an almost equatorial location. The average sodium distribution at Alcantara was found to be very similar to the annual mean for Sao Jose dos Campos (23 degree S), but about 1 km higher than the November mean value of 92 km for the latter site. Only one, weak, sporadic sodium layer was observed during more than 26 h of observations, an occurrence frequency much less than that seen at low latitude sites in the northern hemisphere. A survey of the observations of sporadic layers at various locations suggests that both magnetic dip and declination angles might influence their rate of occurrence

We have used simple exponential atmospheric conductivity models, together with the ion production rates determined from balloon and rocket measurements in the SAMA. An upper limit to this influence was also calculated and compared with the normal diurnal variation of the fair-weather electric field due to the diurnal variation of the global thunderstorm activity

We show that near solar maximum, the solar origin of such structures seems to be associated with active regions* (involving flares and/ or filament eruptions) occurring close to the streamer belt and to growing low-latitude coronal holes. It is also shown that low-latitude coronal holes had a dual-peak solar cycle distribution during solar cycle 21, similar to that previously reported for the above mentioned interplanetary and geomagnetic phenomena

   83:  The distortion effect that the nonuniform equatorial electrojet (EEJ) currents might have on the plane-wave assumption in magnetotelluric (MT) applications is investigated under experimental conditions. A broad-band (0.0006-2048 s) MT survey, consisting of 8 stations aligned at right angles to the magnetic equator and probing diverse geologic terrains, was carried out during the dayhme, under the presence of the EEJ nonuniform source, and at nighttime, when the EEJ flux almost vanishes. A comparison between the daytime and nighttime soundings did not show any significant divergence, contrary to expectation from some theoretical calculations. Thus, the results assure that the traditional plane-wave formula employed in MT can provide reliable subsurface conductivity structures even under the influence of the EEJ, at least up to periods of 2048 s. An additional modelling exercise considering the two models most commonly used to simulate the EEJ sources was also performed. It indicates that the line-current model generates departures from the plane-wave results not observed in practice and that the Gaussian model only agrees with the experimental data, within their error bars, if the geoelectric section approaches its most conductive limit defined from a static shift evaluation

   83:  Measurements of the vector DC electric field, current density, and plasma number density were gathered in the daytime equalorial electrojet on a sounding rocket launched from Alcantara, Brazil. The data set provides a self-consistent picture of the electrodynamics of the daytime electrojet, permitting a detailed comparison of the altitude profiles of the vertical Winponent of the DC electric field, Evert,, the current density, J, and the plasma number density, Ne Good agreement in the upper electrojet region between both the magnitude and the profile of the plasma drifts, calculated independently from Evert/B and Jzonal/qNe, demonstrates that the equatorial electrojet is a Hall current consisting of electron motion driven by a vertical DC electric field. The data support the basic Cowling conductivity ideas of electron flow at the dip equator within a narrow conducting layer in which the ions are at rest

   83:  The Guara Campaign consisted of a series of sounding rockets that were launched from August - October, 1994 at a new launch facility at Alcantara, Brazil, which is within one degree of the Earth's magnetic equator. The campaign consisted of focused scientific experiments designed to investigate the electrodynamics and irregularities in the equatorial ionosphere and mesosphere and to study their relationship with neutral upper atmosphere motions. In all, 13 large sounding rockets and 20 small meteorological rockets were launched as part of four different experiment groups designed to investigate: (1) the daytime equatorial electrojet, (2) very high altitude Spread-F processes, (3) sunset electrodynamics, and (4) middle atmosphere- thermosphere coupling at the equator. All of the experiments utilized ground-based scientific instruments including a VHF backscatter radar interferometer, magnetometers, ionosondes, and scintillation receivers. The project was a joint undertaking of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias (INPE) of Brazil. The project was named the Guara Campaign after a beautiful species of bird that is native to the equatorial region of Brazil

   83:  Equatorial ionospheric irregularities in the F-layer have been the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigations during recent years. The class or irregularities which continues to receive much attention is characterized by large scale plasma depletions, generally referred to as ionospheric plumes and bubbles. The 0I 630.0 nm F-region night-glow emissions arising from recombination processes can be used to observe the dynamics of transequatorial ionospheric plasma bubbles and smaller scale plasma irregularities. In a collaborative project between the Center for Space Physics of Boston University and Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), an all-sky imaging system was operated at Cachoeira Paulista (22,7 degree S, 45.0 degree W, dip latitude 15.8 degree S), between March 1987 and October 1991. In addition to the imager, photometer and VHF polarimeter observations were conducted at Cachoeira Paulista, with ionospheric soundings carried out at both C. Paulista and Fortaleza, the latter at 3.9 degree S, 38.4 degree W, 17- S dip latitude. For this longitude, the observed seasonal variation of the airglow depletions shows a maximum from October through March and a very low occurrence of airglow depletions from April through September. This long series of 0I 630.0 nm, imaging observations has permitted us to determine that when there are extended plumes, the altitudes affected over the magnetic equator often exceed 1500 km and probably exceed 2500 km, at times, the maximum projection that can be seen from Cachoeira Paulista. This holds true even during years of low solar flux

   83:  Digisondes/ionosondes, an HF Doppler radar and magnetometers were operated in Brazil and India during the September/October 1994 GUARA/EITS campaigns. Analysis of the data for the two disturbed intervals, 2-4 October and 2507 September provided evidence of a longitudinal structure in the disturbance dynamo (DD) electric Add at low latitudes. The DD electric field which is westward in the evening, inhibited the developments of the equatorial prereversal electric field and postsunset ESF, whereas the simultaneous eastward field in the predawn sector, did not lead to ESF, contrary to what is normally expected. This nondevelopment of ESF is suggested as evidence of the stabilizing effect of transequatorial neutral winds associated with stormtime circulation. The campaign observations clearly demonstrate that the DD electric fields could often mask the low latitude ionospheric responses to prompt penetration electric fields in the course of sustained substorm

   83:  Studies of equatorial F region evening vertical plasma drifts using different measurement techniques have produced conflicting results. We examine the relationship of incoherent scatter radar and ionosonde drift observations over the Peruvian equatorial region, and AE-E satellite drifts for different geophysical conditions. Our data show that there is large day-to-day variability on the ratios of radar and ionosonde drifts, but on the average the measurements from these two techniques are in fair agreement during low and moderate solar flux conditions. For high solar activity, however, the Jicamarca evening drifts during equinox and December solstice are significantly larger than the ionosonde drifts. These results can be explained by the different height ranges of the radar and ionosonde measurements, and the increase of the upward drift velocity with height below the F region peak. This altitudinal variation is related to the longitudinal gradient of the zonal plasma drifts as a result of he curl-free electric field condition. Our results also indicate that during equinox the increase of the vertical prereversal velocity enhancement with solar activity is largely longitude independent

   83:  Peculiarities of daytime and nighttime Pi 2 pulsations at the dip equator are examined by using multipoint measurements from the 210 degree magnetic meridian (AIAI) magnetometer network. We found that during daytime the amplitude of Pi 2 pulsations at the dip equator is enhanced, and the phase lags  34 degree behind those at low-latitude (magnetic latitude  = 19.5-46.2 degree) stations. On the other hand during nighttime the amplitude of Pi 2 pulsations at the dip equator is depressed, and the phase lags  18 degree behind those at the lower latitudes. Because the zonal ionospheric conductivity at the dip equator is much higher than that at the off-dip equator region, Pi 2 signals are expected to be distorted more effectively at the dip equator. The observations imply that the daytime and nighttime Pi 2 pulsations in the equatorial and low-latitude regions can be explained by invoking an instantaneous penetration of electric field variations from the nightside polar ionosphere to the dayside equatorial ionosphere, and a direct incidence of compressional oscillations from the nightside inner magnetosphere, respectively

   83:  A 48 GHz five-radiometer front end was installed at the Cassegrain focus of the 13.7-m Itapetinga antenna for the observation of solar bursts. The system works with five beam patterns partly overlapping. The five antenna temperatures are recorded with a temporal resolution of 1 millisecond, including time and antenna position. The ratios of the incoming antenna signals are used to determine the centroid of burst emission. Its coordinates are determined from groups of three receivers by using a least-square fit. In favourable observing conditions we obtain an angular accuracy of about 2 are sec (r.m.s.), with a time resolution of 1 ms and a sensitivity of 0.05 s.f.u.The accuracy of the antenna tracking, the absolute pointing and the quality of radio seeing at Itapetinga are discussed. A preliminary analysis of an implusive solar bunt event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the method described here

   83:  A wide-band digital decimetric spectroscope is in the process of development at INPE (Brazil), in conjunction with a 9-m diameter polar mounted antenna. Initially, this spectroscope was operating over a narrow-band 1.6 Ò 0.05 MHz in an analogue mode. Here we report a slow drifting - 5.0 MHz s- 1, narrow-band 16:30-15:80 MHz, split frequency solar burst lasting for about 15 s, observed on 15 June, 1991 The separation between the split components is = 30 MHz, and the upper split frequency component is more intense than the lower split frequency component. These observed characteristics favour the hypothesis of conversion of plasma waves by combinational scattering on upgoing ion-sound waves in a magnetic loop. Existing strong electron density gradients across the magnetic field in the source region will reduce the free-free absorption of radiation at the fundamental frequency. In order to explain the observed temporal characteristics of the upper and lower split frequency components, the radiation has to propagate at some angle to the electron density gradient in the source region. Estimated physical parameters of the source and exciters are as follows: (i) maximum source size (height)  2 x 107 cm; (ii) velocity and length of ion-sound pulse  3.1 x 106 cm s-1 and 5 x 107 cm, respectively, and (iii) velocity of the exciter of plasma waves (electron or proton beam)  5 x 108 cm s-1

   83:  Meteosat-2 satellite data in the visible band were used to calculate monthly averages from daily mean incident solar radiation over Brazil, using the IGMK physical model for the period 1985-1986. Satellite estimates are compared with ground data from 22 national stations. The global root mean square error between model and ground results for all data points was 13
   83:  , and the mean bias error was 1.23 MJ m-2. About 68
   83:   of the individual errors were below 10
   83:   and clustered around 8
   83:  . Global radiation estimated by the model ranged from 9.0 to 27 M.1 m ` with the diffuse to global ratio failing into the 02-0.5 interval. Enhanced inverted zonal trends were found for both satellite predictions and the ground station results

   83:  After characterizing every year in the 120-yr interval 1871-1990 as having an El Nino (EN) or Southern Oscillation minimum (SO), or equatorial sea surface temperature maximum (warm events W) or minimum (cold events C), or any combination of these, or none (nonevents), the rainfalls in various regions of the globe were examined for each category of year, using the data of Ropelewski and Halpert, who had identified some regions as having a negative response (deficit rains) and some as having a positive response (excess rains) to ENSO events. The author finds that this response is best with ENSOW-type events, especially the unambiguous ones (El Nino in the early part of the year and SO and W in the middle of the year), though, in some cases, even ambiguous ENSOW gave good results. Also, the response is reverse for C-type events. Out of the 46 years having El Nino (all types), and 36 years having cold (C) events, the response for some regions is good. But for some other regions, only about half could be associated with the expected response, making predictions uncertain in those regions. Factors other than ENSO may have considerable influence on rainfalls in different regions at different times, thus distorting the ENSO effects

   83:  Pulsar eclipse due u) induced three-wave interactions involving low-frequency acoustic turbulence is discussed. We consider both the case of electron acoustic waves when the ion temperature Ti, is higher than the electron temperature Te and that of ion acoustic waves when Te > Ti. In each case the corresponding growth for low-frequency acoustic waves induced by a high-frequency photon beam evaluated. For T, > Te, the maximum growth rate for electron acoustic waves depends strongly on Ti/Te and may be comparable to that of a Langmuir counte for sufficiently large temperature ratio Ti/Te,. It is shown that induced scatterir electron acoustic waves can be important and can cause pulsar eclipse. We shov that for Te > Ti and in the small-angle approximation, growth of low-frequenc acoustic waves due to the photon beam is always slower than Langnmir wave the corresponding induced scattering is less effective than induced R scattering. Thus, induced Brillouin scattering involving low-frequency ion acoustic waves cannot be the main cause for pulsar eclipses

   83:  The effects Of C02 enrichment and 03 induced stress on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) were studied infield experiments using open-top chambers to simulate the atmospheric concentrations of these two gases that are predicted to occur during the coming century, The experiments were conducted at Beltsville, MD, during 1991 (wheat and corn) and 1992 (wheat). Crops were grown under charcoal filtered (CF) air or ambient air + 40 nl liter- 1 03 (7 h per day, 5 days per week) having ambient C02 concentration (350 l liter-  C02) or + 150 l liter- 1 C02 (12 h per day). Averaged over 03 treatments, the C02-enriched environment had a positive effect on wheat grain yield (26
   83:   in 1991 and 15
   83:   in 1992) and dry biomass (15
   83:  . in 1991 and 9
   83:   in 1992). Averaged over C02 treatments, high 03 exposure had a negative impact on wheat grain yield (- 15

   83:   in 1992) and dry biomass (-11
   83:   in 1991 and -9
   83:   in 1992). Averaged over C02 treatments, high 03 exposure decreased corn grain yield by 9
   83:  . No significant interactive effects were observed for either crop. The results indicated that C02 enrichment had a beneficial effect in wheat (C3 crop) but not in corn (C4 crop). It is likely that the 03-induced stress will be diminished under increased atmospheric C02 concentrations, however, maximal benefits in crop production in wheat in response to C02 enrichment will not be materi-alized under concomitant increases in tropospheric 03 concentration

   83:  Observations of night-time thermospheric neutral wind velocities from measurements of Doppler shifts of the 0I 630.0 nm airglow emission line, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer, have been carried out from 23 degree S geographic latitude in the Brazilian setor during We period March 1988-December 1989. The observing location is situated inside both the equatorial ionospheric and South Atlantic magnetic anomalies. In this paper we present and discuss salient features of the average nocturnal variations of the thermospheric meridional and zonal wind velocities during autumn, winter, spring and slimmer seasons. The results are compared with the wind velocities predicted by the HWM-87 and HWM-90 models. The observed and predicted meridional and zonal wind velocities from the HWM-87 and HWM-90 models show a reasonable agreement in terms of tendencies of nocturnal variations during different seasons. However, some discrepancies arc observed with regard to the magnitudes and detailed variation in the nocturnal patterns. The observed zonal winds are stronger than the meridional winds. Also the summer zonal winds are stronger than in winter, contrary to the HWM-87 model predictions. The observed thermospherie wind velocities, presented here, are comparable with those report from other low latitude stations

   83:  Atmospheric radon measurements were performed airborne in the Brazilian Amazon Basin during the wet season ABLE-2B experiment. The vertical profiles of radon showed a small decrease of concentration with increasing altitude at a rate varying from 6.5 to 11 x 10-2 Bq M-3 km-1. The calculation of the flux balance of radon in the troposphere above the Amazon Basin indicated a residual flux A the upper boundary of the measurement domain (6 km) of 0.14 atom cm-2 s-1. This residue may be associated with the turbulent transport of radon due to cloud activity. A rough estimate of the cloud mass flux at 6 km was of the order of  0.4 x 10-2 kg M-2 s-l. The horizontal survey of radon between Belem (1.5 degree S, 48 . 5 degree W) and Manaus (3 degree S, 60 degree W) performed at two different levels (300 m and 3000 m) indicated strong enhancement of radon near Santarem (2 degree S, 54.5 degree W) at the lower level, and a marked decrease at the higher level flight. It is suggested that mesoscale subsidence in this region inhibited the removal of mixed layer radon by the convective activity

   83:  Ionospheric plasma irregularities associated with nighttime equatorial spread-F phenomena have been the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigations during recent years. Large scale plasma depletions, referred to as transequatorial bubbles or plumes, continue to attract considerable attention. The studies of ionosphere plasma irregularities assume great importance, because the irregularities degrade the radio wave signals passing through the region and, therefore, have considerable influence on the ionospheric/trans-ionospheric radio wave communications. The F-region nightglow emissions arising from ionospheric recombination processes can be used to remotely observe the dynamics of transequatorial ionospheric plasma bubbles and smaller scale plasma irregularities. In a collaborative project between the Center for Space Physics, Boston University, USA- and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil, an all-sky imaging system was put in operation at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degree S, 45.0  degree W, dip latitude 15.8 degree S), in March 1987. This wide angle imaging technique provides an unique capability of permiting observations over regions covering several million square kilometers from a single observing station. Also, regular measurements of several nightglow emissions and ionospheric sounding are carried out at Cachoeira Paulista and Fortaleza (3.9 degree S, 38.4 degree W, dip latitude 3.7 degree S). A VHF electronic polarimeter was in operation at Cachoeira Paulista. This clustering of observational facilities in the Brazilian sector provided coincident and complementary observations of various upper atmospheric parameters. In this paper we present and discuss some features of the 01630.0 nm emission all-sky imaging observations carried out during the period 1987-1989. The transequatorial ionospheric plasma bubbles manifest in all-sky optical imaging observations as nearly north-south aligned intensity-depleted regions. The observed seasonal variation of the airglow depletions shows a maximum during the summer months and virtually no airglow depletions during the winter months. The case studies presented show different forms of generation and development phases of airglow depletions during the course of a night. The all-sky images also permitted the determination of the altitude-latitude extent of the plasma depleted regions and some results are presented. It has been observed that the attitudes reached by the plasma depleted flux tubes over the magnetic equator in the Brazilian sector-often exceed 2500 km

   83:  Neural networks and harmonic analysis by iterative regression are implemented for the prediction of the level of Paraguay River, The selected neural networks include Feed-forward Neural Networks with Backpropagation learning law and Time Delay Neural Network. Using the 1145 monthly mean values, the trained networks predict the levels of the 12 next months with Normalized Mean Squared Error NMSE < 0.06 and Negative Average Log Likelihood NALL.< 9.0. On the other hand, the determination of the most important sine functions embedded in the same series allows to reconstruct the main features of the variations of the river level and to predict yearly mean values for the next two decades (assuming no major change of the environment). The results obtained show that both methods seem to be efficient to process time series related to phenomena influence by complex climatic and geophysical processes, even not dealing with causal relationships involved in the phenomena studied. They may be used to predict future behavior of such phenomena, at ranges depending specifically on the method used, interval, size and quality of data available

Essa area, portanto, ainda reserva surpresas. Estudos feitos em diversos paises, inclusive no Brasil, indicam que a maioria dos relampagos traz carga eletrica negativa para o solo. entretanto, pesquisadores brasileiros descobriram que o Sudeste do pais, de vez em quando, e assolado por tempestades nas quais os raios positivos sao mais numerosos. Tempestades como essas tambem foram identificadas recentemente nos Estados Unidos. Como esses raios sao mais dstrutivos que os de carga negativas, e importante conhecer as tempestdes positivas

   83:  We have obtained low-tesolution (1 nm) CCD spectrograms of Nova Sco 1992 covering the range 480-1090 nm, using the 1.6-m telescope of LNA/CNPq in Brazil. On May 28.0 UT, the visible spectrum was like that described on IAUC 5529 and the near-infrared was chatacterized by strong emission of 0 I at 844.6 nm and the Ca II triplet. Less intense emission of Fe II 974,49,42), N I, AND Paschen lines were also present. An unidentified blend at 1069-1076 nm was the dominant feature in the spectrum, being stronger than H Coude CCD spectra (resolution 0.1 nm) taken on June 1.1 show P-Cyg absorptions with minima at -290 km/s (OI at 844.6 nm), 355 km/s (Ca II triplet) and -345 kml/s (H).

   83:  The relationship between El Nino and droughts in north-east Brazil is poor. From 46 El Nino events (strong and moderate) during 1849-1992, only 21 (ca. 46 per.cent) were associated with droughts at Fortaleza, Ceara (north-east Brazil) and only 26 (ca. 57 per cent) with negative deviations (of any size). Thus, forecasts of droughts based on the appearance of El Nino alone would be wrong half the time. Instead, predictions based on significant periodicities (ca. 13 and ca. 26 years) give reasonably good results. Data up to 1978 could predict the drought that occurred during 1979-1983, although the severe drought of 1983 was attributed to a strong El Nino. Mild droughts during 1991-1993 were also foreseen. In future, severe droughts are predicted for 2000-2010 in north-east Brazil. However, the prediction skill is not very good and predictions should be checked by analysis of as much updated data as possible. Predictions beyond about 5-10 years are not reliable. The significant periodicities in North-east Brazil rainfall series might be related to periodicities in Atlantic parameters (sea-surface temperatures, etc.) that are well correlated with north-east Brazil rainfall

   83:  The contribution of the excited state species O(1S) to the production of 0(1D) in the nocturnal Fregion is investigated here utilizing rocketborne electron density and photometric (557.7 nm and 630 nm) airglow dam obtained over Natal (geogr. 5.8 degree S, 35.2 degree W), in Brazil, on October 31, 1986. Even though this contribution is rather small it is observed to remarkably vary with height. In the bottomside ionosphere it varies from 1. 15
   83:   at 190 km to 6.85
   83:   at 265 km. It is suggested here that such rapid height variation in the contribution at the bottornside ionosphere is associated with a positive height gradient of the 02+ population at higher vibrational levels (v = 1 and 2). Such hypothesis is consistent with the fact that in the individual neutral dissociative state of the  symmetry, which is the only source channel for the 0(1S), the rate of production of 0(1D) increases with v. The contribution of the cascading process W the 0I 630 nm airglow, which is generally assumed to be negligible, is found here to be about 5. 1 
   83:   of the total 0I 630 nm airglow intensity

   83:  A new generation mechanism for electromagnetic waves near the fundamental plasma frequency is discussed. It is shown that a travelling Langmuir pump wave can nonlinearly convert into electromagnetic, Langmuir and ion-acoustic daughter wave via a hybrid stimulated modulational instability. The linear and nonlinear temporal dynamics of this modulational process involving coupling to a resonant ion-acoustic wave are studied. The wave energy conservation relations are derived. The roles of frequency mismatch, dissipation and wave dispersion in the temporal evolution of nonlinear coupling of two wave triplets are analysed

   83:  One of the most significant environmental changes that occurs in our atmosphere, the ozone depletion in the stratosphere, produces increases in damaging UV-B radiation at the surface, especially in Antarctica. The largest populations nearest to the ozone hole region are Punta Arenas (53.0 degree S, 70.90 degree W, Chile) and Ushuaia (54.5 degree S, 68.0 degree W, Argentina) at the southern extreme of the South-American continent. The ozone trend near these locations is - 0.5
   83:   per year using the yearly averages, and - 1.2
   83:   per year using the October means. This is 2 to 5 times larger than the global average. UV-B radiation has been measured at Punta Arenas in small spectral bands, from 290 nm to 320 nm, during "normal" and "perturbed" conditions. It has been found that at Punta Arenas, during significant ozone column reductions, the largest UVB increase occurs near 296-297 nm, which is the wavelength where the human skin has its highest sensitivity to UV-B. The relative factor of enhancement has been observed to vary between 10 and 38, depending on the values used for normalization. At longer wavelengths these enhancement factors are lower, until they equal unity at about 325 nm. The integrated biologically effective radiation on perturbed days iE more than twice as large as the "normal" values

   83:  The knowledge of the composition of atmospheric aerosols in remote areas, like the Antarctic Peninsula is of great importance for the study of long-range transport of atmospheric contaminants and also from the climatological point of view. Instrumental neutron activation analysis was applied in the present work to determine the elements Al, V, Mn, Na, Cl, Ca, Au, Br, Sb, Sc, Fe, Zn, K Th and La in aerosol samples collected in the Brazilian Antarctic Station "Comandante Ferraz" (62 degree S, 58 degree W) located on King George Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The sources of the aerosols were investigated by means of Enrichment Factors and Principal Factor Analysis. Both methods yielded similar results. Sea and soil were identified as the major sources of aerosols, in the samples collected at the Brazilian Station

The conference was held in Pasadena, California, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 12-1 February 1996. Topics covered the relevant time-varying phenomena at the sun/corona, propagation c these structures through interplanetary space, the response of the magnetosphere from its interactio: with these interplanetary structures, the formation of the storm-time ring-current (in particular the oxygen content of the ring-current), and storm ionospheric effects and ground based effects. A complementary summary is provided by Gonzalez et al. in EOS, 1996. The full set of review articles will be published in an AGU monograph and many of the contributed articles will appear in a special section of the Journal of Geaphysical Research Space Physics

   83:  Continuous measurements of radon-222 were conducted at Comandante Ferraz (62 degree S, 58 degree W), a Brazilian station in the Antarctic Peninsula, during the winters of 1986 and 1987. The average concentration of radon-222 was 0.026 Ò 0.018 Bq M-3 in 1986 and 0.014 Ò 0.008 Bq m-3 in 1987. The higher average of 1986 was attributed to the stronger winds in 1986 compared to those observed in 1987. Large surges of radon reaching up to 0.13 Bq M-3 were affected by local radon emissions due to soil defrosting. Bare soils and atmospheric stability also favored local contributions. Radon peaks attributed uniquely to air mass trajectories passing over the South American continent occurred during the 2 years of monitoring. Periodicities; of 25 to 30 days in the time series of radon corroborate with previous results obtained by other authors in east Antarctica

   83:  We present an evaluation of global-scale equatorial and low latitude ionospheric disturbances in response to the weak-to-moderate disturbed conditions that marked the SUNDL,kL/ATLAS 1 twelvc-day campaign of March 22 to April 2, 1992, lonosonde data from South American and Indian-Asian longitudes are analyzed to examine first the climatological (the average) pattern of the critical F region parameters, (the layer peak density and height) in comparison with the empirical International Reference Ionospheric model, and then to characterize the day-to-day variabilities aiming at identifying potential causal contributions from either disturbance zonal and meridional winds or magnetosphcric and disturbance dynamo electric fields. Included in this analysis are data from South American midlatitude locations which are used to determine meridional winds using an adaptation of the servo analysis technique in the Field Line Integrated Plasma (FLIP) model. We have made an assessment of the causal mechanism of the day-to-day variabilities as arising from latitude dependent disturbance meridional winds, and from electric fields produced by disturbance zonal winds and disturbance dynamo. While the contribution from disturbance meridional winds decreases from middle to equatorial latitudes, that of the electric fields maximizes around the equator. In particular, first-time evidence based on ionosonde data is provided for a disturbance dynamo electric field in the equatorial ionosphere. It is found that there are two time intervals of maximum ionospheric variability resulting from the weak to moderate magnetospheric disturbance conditions that prevailed during the campaign: one near the evcning/postsunset hours and the other in the postmidnight-sunrise hours over low latitudes. At midlatitudes a broad maximum of the response occurs from premidnight to morning hours. We provide a comparison of results for the South American and Indian-Asian longitudes and a discussion of the competing roles of the disturbance zonal and meridional winds, and magnetospheric and disturbance dynamo electric fields as a function of latitude

   83:  Estudou-se um evento de ciclogenese que ocorreu sobre o Uruguai entre os dias 9 e 10 de julho de 1996, utilizando os dados diarios de temperatura, pressao reduzida ao nivel do mar, geopotencial, velocidade vertical e ventos, em 17 niveis isobaricos, do conjunto da reanalise do National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). O estudo foi baseado nas analises isobarica e isentropica destes parametros, meteorologicos e tambem na analise dos campos de vorticidade potencial. O ciclone extratropical estudado formou-se a partir da propagacao de um vortice ciclonico em altos niveis originado sobre o Oceano Pacifico. Este vortice ciclonico estendia-se ate a superficie e ao cruzar a Cordilheira dos Andes, favoreceu a formacao de um ciclone extratropical sobre a America do Sul. A analise sinotica do evento revelou que este caso pode ser "classificado" como ciclogenese orografica, dada a importÉncia fundamental que a presenca da barreira montanhosa teve na intensificacao da baroclinica em superficie, levando a formacao do ciclone extratropical. A interacao do vortice em altos niveis com a onda estacionaria induzida pela Cordilheira Andina, definiu a estrutura baroclinica na vertical que alimentou o sistema em seu estagio de desenvolvimento. Invertendo numericamente os campos totais e da perturbacao de vorticidade potencial, foi possivel recuperar os campos de vento e geopotencial associados. Os resultados mostram que a circulacao foi reproduzida pela parte dinamicamente balanceada do escoamento. Tambem foi avaliada a contribuicao relativa de tres anomalias distintas: da temperatura potencial em superficie e da vorticidade potencial em altos e baixos niveis Os resultados revelaram que em baixos niveis, a contribuicao mais importante para a ciclogenese em superficie (em termos de intensidade) estava relacionada com as anomalias de vorticidade potencial em baixos niveis. A contribuicao conjunta das anomalia de temperatura em superficie e de vorticidade potencial em baixos niveis definiu a posicao do ciclone em superficie. Em altos niveis, a circulacao ciclonica foi devida essencialmente a anomalia de vorticidade potencial na alta troposfera

   83:  Um metodo para a obtencao do Conteudo Eletronico Total (CET), a partir das observaveis do "Global Positioning System" (GPS) e apresentado. A maior parte dos dados disponiveis de CET, no setor sul-americano, foi obtida atraves de medidas de rotacao Faraday, que nao contem a contribuicao dos eletrons situados acima de 2.000 km de altura. Todavia, valores de CET que incluem o conteudo eletronico plasmasferico, podem ser obtidos atraves dos dados de satelites GPS. O metodo utiliza-se da caracteristica dispersiva do meio ionosferico para determinar o conteudo eletronico total a partir da diferenca entre medidas de codigo e fase simultaneas, nas duas frequencias dos sinais enviados pelos satelites GPS. Medidas do CET foram obtidas atraves deste metodo para estacoes receptoras, pertencentes a rede "International GPS Service" (IGS), situadas nas regioes da America do Sul e Peninsula Antartica. Os resultados permitiram efetuar um estudo da variacao diurna, latitudinal e sazonal do CET, nestas regioes, para uma epoca de baixa atividade solar, em condicoes ionosfericas magneticamente calmas. Estes resultados sao comparados com modelos empiricos de ionosfera (IRI-95) e plasmasfera (Gallagher-88). Uma analise dos dados em condicoes ionosfericas magneticamente calmas e perturbadas e a observacao de flutuacoes ionosfericas, mostra o potencial do estudo do efeito das tempestades magneticas e irregularidades ionosfericas a partir da utilizacao de dados do GPS

Abstract: The increasing use of the Internet for the transfer of digital data requires computational systems able to provide the privacy, integrity and accessability of such data. Furthermore, the computational system itself shall be safe, ensure the serviceability of its computers and local network and attend the requirements of a given institution or company. The specification of this computational system shall be made in order to conform the adopted safety policy. The current work proposes a safe computational system, designed to meet the requirements of the safety policy of a particular institution or company. As part of this system, it was developed and tested the prototype of a software aimed for safe data transfer. This software was derived from the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). As this service is intended for files that are limited in size, it was suitable to choose the connectionless protocol User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Data integrity and inviolability is ensured by cryptography and also authentication and authorization procedures. The proposed service uses a methodology for data encryptation, which is based on two public domain cryptography algorithms

   83:  Simulacoes numericas de um evento de ciclogenese no Atlantico Sul foram conduzidas para analisar o comportamento de tres parametrizacoes de cumulus, (Kuo; Kain e Fritsch; Fritsch e Chappell). 0 modelo atmosferico utilizado e o da Japan Meteorological. Ageney, adaptado para America do Sul. A dependencia das parametrizacoes de cumulus a resolucao horizontal foi examinada considerando duas grades (75 e 25 km), Durante as 72 horas de simulacao com 75 km identificou-se duas fases distintas na atuacao das parametrizacoes de conveccao. Na primeira fase, ate 36 horas, o ciclone possui caracteristicas semelhantes com os tres esquemas. Na segunda fase, apos 36 horas, o ciclone foi mais profundo com o esquema de Kuo. As semelhancas na primeira fase foram atribuidas a atmosfera condicionalmente instavel e com alto teor de umidade na coluna vertical nas imediacoes do ciclone. Sob essas condicoes, o aquecimento diabatico total possui distribuicao vertical e intensidade muito proxima para os tres esquemas, embora com particoes diferentes entre convectivo e na escala da grade em funcao da parametrizaáao de cumuius utilizada. Na segunda fase, a instabilidade condicional restringe-se ao centro-norte do ciclone, onde os esquemas de Kain e Fritsch e Fritsch e Chappell mostraram maior area com atividade convectiva do que o de Kuo. No entanto, ao sul do ciclone a atmosfera tomou-se condicionalmente estavel e dominou o esquema na,escala da grade, independente da parametrizacao de conveccao. Porem, o aquecimento diabatico total foi maior com a parametrizacao de Kuo, explicando assim o ciclone mais intenso. A reducao do espacamento de grade (25 km) define melhor a estrutura de mesoescala associada ao ciclone, mas sem modificar as principais caracteristicas das duas fases mencionadas. Um experimento adicional mostrou que a liberaáao de calor latente foi fundamental para o desenvolvimento e deslocamento do ciclone com ambas resolucoes horizontais. Abstract: Numerical simulations of a South Atlantic cyclogenese event were performed in order to examine the role of three cumulus parameterizations (Kuo; Kain and Fritsch; Fritsch and Chappelly The atmospheric model employed is the Japan Meteorological Agency limited area model, adapted to the South America region. The effect of the cumulus parameterization depending on the horizontal resolution was examined by running the model with grid length of 75 km and 25 km. In a 72 h run with the 75 km grid-length two distinct phases were identified. The first phase, from 0 to 36 h, showed similar features for the three schemes. In the second phase, from 36 h onward, the Kuo parameterization yielded a more deeper cyclone. The similarities in the first phase were attributed to a wet and conditional unstable atmosphere surrounding the cyclone. Under these conditions, the total diabatic heating was very similar with the three schemes, although they presented different partitions between grid-scale and convective heating. In the second phase, the conditional instability arose on the north flank of the cyclone, where the Kain and Fritsch and Fritsch and Chappell schemes showed a larger areal convective activity than the Kuo. However, in the southern region of the cyclone the atmosphere became stable, and the grid-scale scheme was dominant in the three schemes. Nevertheless, the total diabatic heating was larger with the Kuo parameterization, which explains the more intense cyclone. The increase of the horizontal resolution enhanced the mesoscale structure associated with the cyclone. However no significant modifications on the two phases were observed. An additional experiment evidenced that the release latent heat played a crucial role on the development and displacement of the cyclone in both spatial resolutions

With the increase in the number of images collected every day from different sensors, automated registration of multi-sensor, multi-spectral and multi-temporal images has become an important issue. In this thesis an efficient algorithm for the registration of multi-temporal images with similar spectral responses is proposed. The procedure is completely automatic and relies on the grey level information content of the images and their local wavelet transform modulus maxima. The algorithm is performed at progressively higher resolution, which allows for faster implementation and higher registration precision. The registration algorithm is very simple, easy to apply and reasonably emcient in terms of computational complexity. Extensive experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm as well as measurements of its performance

   83:  Neste estudo foram utilizados dados medidos em torre micrometeorologica, localizada no municipio de Miranda (19 graus 6' S e 57 graus 0' W) Pantanal Matogrossense para caracterizar aspectos da estrutura da turbulencia na Camada Limite Atmosferica em periodo de transicao entre a estacao umida e a estacao seca. A Transformada em Ondeletas foi utilizada na analise dos sinais turbulentos, o que possibilitou a filtragern passa-alto dos dados turbulentos e a obtencao de diagramas em tempo-escala que mostraram aspectos interessantes da variabilidade das contribuicao por escala para os fluxos turbulentos. E possivel que as caracteristicas do Pantanal semi-inundado favorecam o surgimento de circulacao locais e consequentemente, de flutuacao de baixa frequencia, o que dificulta a definicao de uma falha espectral. e a separacao entre media e flutuacao turbulenta. Os dados medidos com instrumentos de resposta lenta, provavelmente dentro da subcamada de transicao, mostraram alguma discrepancia com as relacao estabelecidas pela Teoria da Similaridade de Monin e Obukhov, especialmente para as trocas de momentum sob condicao instaveis. Os dados obtidos com instrumentos de resposta rapida, medidos acima da subcamada de transicao, apresentaram bom acordo com as parametrizacao dos momentos turbulentos de segunda ordem. As caracteristicas complexas do terreno nao eram totalmente isotropicas e a altura do deslocamento do plano-zero, calculado pelo metodo de De-Bruin e Verhoef, variou segundo a direcao do vento medio. As informacoes fornecidas pelos espectros turbulentos das componentes horizontais de velocidade, permitiram que se estimasse razoavelmente bem, atraves da metodologia proposta por Liu e Ohtaki, a altura da camada de mistura para condicao instaveis. Abstract: In this study it was used data from the micrometeorological tower located at Miranda city ( 19 degree 6' S 5 degree 0 W), in the Pantanal Matogrossense, in order to characterize aspects of the structure of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer, in the transition period between wet and dry seasons. The Wavelet Transform was used in the analysis of the turbulent signals, which allowed the high-pass filtering of the turbulent data and the obtained time-scale diagrams showed interesting aspects of the variability of covariance contribution to turbulent fluxes in different scales. It is possible that the semi-flooded Pantanal characteristics favor the presence of local circulations, and as a consequece, low-frequency flutuations, makes difficult to define accurately the spectral flaw and the separation between the average and turbulent flutuation. The data taken from the slow response instruments showed some discrepancy compared to the relations established by the Monin-Obukov Similarity Theory, specially concerning the momentum exchanges under unstable conditions, probably due to the transition sublayer. The data measured from fast response instruments, taken above the transition sublayer, presented good agreement compared to the parameterizations of turbulent momentum of second order. The complex characteristics of the terrain were not totally isotropic and the displacement height of the zero-plane, calculated by the De-Bruin and Verhoef method, changed according to the average wind direction, The infomation given by the turbulent spectra of the horizontal components of velocity allowed a good estimation of the mixed layer height for unstable conditions, utilizing the methodology proposed by Liu and Ohtaki

Neste trabalho, estimou-se a emissividade do territorio brasileiro considerando-se uma solucao da Equacao de Transferencia Radiativa (ETR), dados de temperatura de brilho obtidos a partir do "Special Sensor Microwave/Imager" (SSW/I) e dados de temperatura da superficie obtidos pelo sistema "TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder" (TOVS). A contribuicao atmosferica foi estimada a partir de simulacoes com o modelo "Atmospheric Transmission at Millimetrie and submillimetric wavelengths" (ATM). Calculou-se a emissividade da superficie continental nos meses de julho e dezembro de 1997, para os canais do SSM/I em 19 e 85 GHz. Para verificar o padrao de rugosidade da superficie efetuou-se a diferenáa entre os campos de emissividade de polarizacao vertical e horizontal. Os resultados mostraram que os padroes regionais e as mudanáas sazonais nas estimativas de emissividade da superficie continental sao consistentes com a topografia de grande escala e com a distribuicao espacial da vegetacao. Abstract: Microwave emissivities of land surface were estimated from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) observations using the 19 and 85 GHz channels, and surface skin temperature data derived from the Tiros Operacional Vertical Sounder (TOVS). The atmospheric contribution was calculated from simulations of the Atmospheric Transmission at Millimetric and submillimetric wavelengths (ATM) model. The microwave emissivities over Brazil were estimated for July and December, 1997, using the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). The emissivity polarization difference was performed to verify the land surface roughness patterns. The results show that the regional patterns and the vegetation seasonal changes retrieved from the land surface emissivities are compatible with the large scale topography and vegetation distributions. Thus, the estimation of the microwave emissivities of land surface may be used to retrieve some atmospheric parameters (clouds) and monitor the land surface (for instance, vegetation and floods)m

Abstract: This work presents the application of genetic algorithms in the design of controllers for the attitude control of an artificial satellite, in the sun pointing phase. First, a PD controller is presented, whose gains were learned by a genetic algorithm. Then, two fuzzy controllers are presented, whose parameters were obtained using a genetic algorithm with the same fitness function employed for deriving of the PD controller. The fitness function used here is a global measure of the performance of each solution, in relation to an already existing simulator for this satellite model. This work also brings a comparative analysis of these controllers, in relation to a PD controller developed by the poles placement method

   83:  No passado, as atividades de projeto na area espacial enfatizavam sobremaneira os requisitos de um sistema. Os metodos empregados baseavam-se principalmente em aspectos funcionais. Recentemente, estas abordagens foram questionadas por desprezarem os custos envolvidos, que eram estimados na etapa final de concepcao. Por isto, novos metodos foram propostos para se conduzir um projeto. Dentre eles, propos um metodo orientado a custos ("design-to-cost" - DTC) que englobasse adequadamente aspectos relevantes envolvidos na elaboracao de um sistema e que tivessem reflexos no custo.

A confiabilidade e "aliada subsidiariamente. 0 metodo proposto procura englobar diferentes abordagens na solucao e/ou otimizacao de um problema, independentemente de seu grau de complexidade. bstract: In the past, space design activities commonly emphasized mainly the system requirements. The available methods focused on functional aspects only. The cost was estimated at the end of the process. Recently, new design methodologies have been proposed. Among them, the design-to-cost (DTC) method was developed to include the cost as a parameter. In this work, we propose a DTC method for systems analysis and specification applied to the design of a reaction wheel. Its basic components are described. General information on system development is related. The object-oriented approach is used as a modeling tool. Performance indexes are defined. A set of algebraic equations describes the cost behavior as a function of system parameters. Reliability is evaluated secondarily. The proposed model embodies many approaches to solve and/or optimize a problem with any level of complexity

   83:  Os Processos Semi-Markovianos de Decisao modelam a operacao de sistemas cujos comportamentos estao sujeitos a tomadas de decisao sequenciais e a aleatoriedades. Existem tres metodos classicos para resolucao destes processos: o Algoritmo de iteracao de Politicas, a formulacao e resolucao de um Problema de Programacao Linear correspondente e o Algoritmo de Iteracao de Valores. No ultimo metodo, do qual trata o presente trabalho, tradicionalmente se reduz o Processo Semi-Markoviano de Decisao a um Processo Markoviano de Decisao a Tempo Discreto atraves de uma mudanca de variaveis chamada uniformizacao. Neste trabalho apresenta-se um Algoritmo de Iteracoes de valores que dispensa o uso da uniformizacao juntamente com o desenvolvimento teorico que o justifica e os resultados numericos de sua aplicacao na otimizacao de filas M/G/1/N com taxa de servico controlavel e de filas M/M/c/N com numero de servidores controlavel; cabendo ressaltar que, nos dois casos, o algoritmo proposto apresentou um desempenho computacional superior aos algoritmos encontrados na literatura. ABSTRACT:  The Semi-Markovian Decision Process models system operations which are subject to sequential decision making with uncertainty. Three classic algorithms are used in these models: Policy Iteration, Linear Programming and value Iteration. The latter, about which is the present work, traditionally reduces the Semi-Markovian Decision Process to a Discrete Time Markovian Decision Process through a variable transformation called uniformization. In this work, a Modified Value Iteration Algorithm is used without the uniformization, together with the theoretical development that justifies it and the numerical application to an M/G/1/N queueing system with controllable service rate and the M/M/c/N queueing system with controllable number of servers. It is important to highlight that in the two cases, the proposed algorithm presented a higher computational result in relation to the algorithms presented in the literature

The satellite model investigated is composed of a rigid hub plus a flexible cantilevered beam with a proof-mass actuator (PMA) located at free end. As the satellite manouvers from rest to a pre-defined position, the rigid body motion can excite the flexible part of the satellite. The PMA tasks is to damp-out any vibration caused by this manouver efficiently. The rigid/flexible satellite is modeled, using a relatively simple structural dynamics approach. Having found the vibration modes of the structure, expressions for kinetic and potential energy are derived. Lagrange's equation is then applied to obtain the satellite equations of motion Numerical simulations evaluate the vibration control problem for different control manouvers strategies. It is evaluated the behavior of the poles and zeros as a function of the increase of the mass located in the extremity of the beam. It is observed that the PMA, together with a propolonal plus integral control law, provides a control force proportional to the velocity of the flexible structure. Based on this, it is shown that the approach of using N such actuators is effective to control the first N vibration modes

   83:  Esta tese trata de uma proposta de uma modelagem hierarquica hibrida, abordando o problema de correspondencia na estereoscopia em visao computacional, utilizando o raciocinio com incerteza e algoritmos geneticos, na busca pela melhor solucao para o problema de correspondencia de pontos multiplos entre imagens. 0 modelo propoe a extracao de um conjunto de caracteristicas de cada ponto e de seus vizinhos, consistindo de informacao contextual (area) e estrutural (tokens). A similaridade e verificada pela comparacao de tais caracteristicas, do ponto de referencia para os pontos candidatos a correspondencia, usando-se medidas de similaridade. Estas medidas sao transformadas em probabilidades basicas (massas) ou crencas, que indicam o grau de certeza de um ponto corresponder a uma referencia, segundo cada caracteristica (ou evidencia). Um processo iterativo e proposto para alterar a convergencia da correspondencia no caso da existencia de problemas provenientes do processo de aquisicao das imagens, como por exemplo, a oclusao. Tambem propoe-se a correspondencia simultanea de N pontos, utilizando as mesmas evidencias de similaridade. 0 uso de N pontos, introduz uma nova restricao no problema a coerencia estrutural entre as regioes poligonais (ou metaobjetos), que emergem da interconexao dos pontos. Esta restricao esta relacionada com as caracteristicas geometricas dos meta-objetos. Assim, no processo de correspondencia, alem de ser necessario satisfazer as restricoes estabelecidas por Marr (1982), os pontos candidatos juntos devem formar uma regiao poligonal, semelhante aquela formada pelos pontos de referencia. A complexidade aumenta com o aumento do numero de pontos simultaneos considerados, implicando em caracteristicas geometricas mais complexas que podem aumentar a seletividade das possibilidades de correspondencia. 0 espaco de busca pelos pontos correspondentes depende do numero dos possiveis pontos candidatos por vertice, tornando complexo o processo de correspondencia, 0 modelo proposto usa um algoritmo genetico para realizar esta tarefa, considerando as evidencias de similaridade adotadas para compor a funcao de avaliacao por minimizacao ou por maximizacao, incorporando as restricoes do problema. Para otimizar o tempo de processamento, propoe-se tambem a utilizacao de um algoritmo genetico paralelo em modelo de ilha. Neste modelo, varias populacoes diferentes evoluem separadamente, havendo migracao de individuos entre as populacoes. Sao apresentados resultados da execucao do modelo com algoritmo genetico sequencial e paralelo, sobre imagens reais, mostrando a adequacao do modelo tratado nesta para o problema de correspondencia em questao. ABSTRACT: This thesis proposes a hierarchical point wise approach to the correspondence problem in stereopsis, using a hybridization of reasoning under uncertainty and genetic algorithms for establishing the best solution, in a simultaneous multi point approach. The proposed model extracts a set of features from the point and its neighborhood, consisting of both context (area) and structural (token) information. Similarity is measured by comparison of such features, from the reference to the candidate points. The measurements are then assigned basic probabilities or mass, indicating the confidence degree (belief) a point corresponds to a reference. Simultaneous correspondence is also proposed for N points, under the same similarity criteria. The use of N points permits the adoption of a new constraint to the problem, resulting from the polygonal region (or meta-object) generated by the interconnection of the points. This constraint is stated as the structural coherence, related to the geometric features of the resulting meta-object. Then, besides satisfying the constraints stated in Marr (1982), the candidate points all together must form a similar polygonal region to that of the reference points. The larger is the number of simultaneous points taken, the more complex is the meta-object to be searched. Complexity of the objects implies complex geometric features, which can increase selectivity of possible correspondences. The search space depends upon the number of candidates for each individual point; thus it can be a very large space. The proposed model uses a genetic algorithm for searching such space, taking into account the similarity criteria adopted, to formulate the fitness function that can be minimized or maximized, and incorporates the constraints of the problem. The island model genetic algorithm is used to provide fast processing to the whole correspondence task. This model consists in the simultaneous evolution of several different populations, with the migration of individuals among them. Thus, different regions of the search space are exploited and the best individual solutions can be exchanged. Some experimental results, using sequential and parallel genetic algorithms, are presented to show the adequacy of the model to the correspondence problem at hand

   83:  0 escopo deste trabalho concentra-se no uso de metodos capazes de geracao de texturas sinteticas de aparencia natural, a partir da reproducao de padroes fonte previamente selecionados. Modelos estatisticos espaciais sao a base para os metodos utilizados, especificamente a modelagem baseada em processos autorregressivos e de media movel para a estimacao de parametros e geracao de padroes de textura. Dois metodos sao utilizados para a estimacao de parametros, ambos baseados em processos autorregressivos. 0 primeiro metodo e baseado na utilizacao da funcao de autocorrelacao linear e na concatenacao de linhas e colunas da textura analizada. 0 segundo metodo utiliza a funcao de autocorrelacao bidimensional concatenada, sendo capaz de evitar a acumulacao de erros ocasionada por correlacoes indesejadas geradas pelo processo de concatenacao de linhas e colunas, ao ser utilizada a autocorrelacao linear. 0 procedimento de sintese e baseado na geracao de um campo ruido branco bidimesional de media zero e mesma variancia dos residuos obtidos a partir do processo de modelagem, que e o ruido branco motor de um processo autorregressivo bidimensional, o qual resultara na textura sintetica. Para imagens de radar de abertura sintetica, foi utilizada uma tecnica de pre-processamento submetendo as amostras das imagens a transformacao pela curva raiz cubica, como uma forma de obtencao de distribuicao aproximadamente gaussiana. Imagens obtidas por sensores oticos dos satelites Landsat-5 e JERS-1 tambem sao submetidas aos metodos, bem como texturas naturais tais quais marmore e granito. Um programa computacional grafico multiplataforma utilizando linguagem IDL foi desenvolvido, contendo todas as funcionalidades necessarias para a modelagem autorregressiva e a sintese de texturas.ABSTRACT: The scope of this work is the use of methods capable of generating natural looking synthetic textures reproducing previously selected source patterns. Spatial statistic models are the basis for the used methods, specifically autoregressive moving average modeling for parameter estimation and texture pattern generation. Two methods are used for parameter estimation; both are based on autoregressive processes. The first method is based on using the linear autocorrelation function and on concatenating rows and columns of the analyzed texture. The second method uses a concatenated two dimensional autocorrelation function, and is able to avoid cumulative errors caused by undesired correlations generated by the row and column concatenation process using linear autocorrelation. The synthesis procedure is based on generating a zero mean two dimensional random white noise field which has the same variance as the residuals obtained from the modeling process. This white noise is the driver for a twodimensional autoregressive process, which results in a synthetic texture. For synthetic aperture radar images, a pre-processing technique using cubic root transformation on the image samples is used, as a way to obtain a near-Gaussian distribution. Images obtained by Landsat-5 and JERS-1 optical sensors are also tested, and so do natural textures such as marmour and granite. A graphic multiplatform computer-based program was developed using IDL language, containing all necessary functionalities for autoregressive modeling and texture synthesis

ABSTRACT: Brazil, through National Institute for Space Research (INPE) is on its way to launch the first Scientific Applications Satellite, SACI-1 together with the first China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite, CBERS1. The SACI-1 intends the utilization of one onboard autonomous attitude control made by magnetic coils placed on the directions of the principal axes of inertia, and using as sensors: a 3 axes magnetometer and a 2 axes sun sensor. The simulation, implementation and validation of an autonomous control software in the onboard digital computer are innovations for Brazil and for INPE, and our previous experience does not include them. This work, even though general, takes for base the characteristics of SACI-1 and may contribute to its development. It shows how to do the simulation and implementation of the digital control laws operating in real time that controls the spin axis direction as well as controls the satellite's spin taking into account aspects of great importance, like: sample period; quantization size; duration of inputs, outputs and processing of the data, etc. This work presents 4 possibilities to do the simulation and implementation emphasizing the one that is being utilized, where two IBM PCs are utilized, one representing the satellite and another one representing the controller. It also shows the aspects related with data communication utilizing as interface the MEGAOUT SERIAL 03 board that contains 8 serial communication gates and how to do its programming

No metodo manual a selecao dos pontos de controle foi realizada manualmente atraves da tela do computador No metodo automatico esta escolha e feita pelo algoritmo atraves da semelhanca das feicoes adquiridas das imagens. Para analisar a precisao das imagens registradas foram calculados o Erro de Registro atraves de dois metodos. Um deles, de uso tradicional, e a raiz quadrada do erro medio quadratico (RMSE), que e a medida dos erros residuais entre alguns pontos de teste escolhidos na imagem. 0 outro e o Metodo da Variancia, que nao e de uso comum, e trabalha com dois tipos de erros: erro geometrico e o erro de medida. Ele calcula o erro total e subtrai o erro de medida gerado pelo processo que esta sendo usado para calcular o erro. ABSTRACT: In this work were appraised and tested two methods of registrations of images of sensor TM (Landsat), a manual (traditional) and the other automatic ( Li et al, 1995). In the manual method the selection of the control points was accomplished manually through the screen of the computer. In the automatic method this choice is made by the algorithm through the likeness of the acquired features of the images. To analyze the precision of the registered images they were calculated the accuracy of registration through two methods. One of them, of traditional use, is the root mean square error (RMSE), that is the measure of registration accuracy among some test points chosen in the image. The other is the Method of the Variance, that is not of common use, and it works with two types of errors: geometric error and the measurement error. It calculates the total error and it subtracts the measurement error generated by the process that is being used to measure the accuracy.

   83:  As caracteristicas da circulacao atmosferica associadas a variabilidade da precipitacao durante o periodo chuvoso principal (NDJ) do sul do Nordeste sao determinadas atraves de ACP, Analise de "Cluster" e analise de eventos extremos de precipitacao. Utilizou-se dados diarios de precipitacao, dados da reanalise do NCEP, dados de ROL e dados de TSM, Os sistemas meteorologicos de verao que atuam sobre a America do Sul, bem como os fenomenos associados a variabilidade destes, como o ENSO, oscilacao 30-60 dias e padrao de onda do Pacifico ate a America do Sul sao identificados. Nestas analises as anomalias positivas (negativas) de precipitacao sobre o sul do Nordeste estao relacionadas a fase positiva (negativa) do ENSO. Na escala intrasazonal verifica-se que a variabilidade da ZCAS, da ZCPS e do cavado do Nordeste estao correlacionadas. Ressalta-se que o padrao chuvoso esta relacionado com o deslocamento da ZCAS para norte e da ZCPS para leste e tambem o posicionaniento do cavado do Nordeste sobre o Oceano. 0 padrao seco associa-se com o posicionamento da ZCAS em latitudes mais ao sul e o cavado do Nordeste sobre ou proximo ao continente. 0 padrao chuvoso esta associado a intensa conveccao sobre o leste da Amazonia e deslocamento da AB para leste, escoamento em baixos niveis da Amazonia para o sul do Nordeste e intensificacao dos alisios de nordeste sobre a costa setentrional da America do Sul. No padrao seco verifica-se a AB a oeste da sua posicao climalogica, escoamento em baixos niveis direcionado da Amazonia para latitudes ao sul e enfraquecimento dos alisios de nordeste sobre a costa norte da America da Sul. Sobre o Atlantico Sul o deslocamento da Alta Subtropical para leste e enfraquecimento dos alisios de sudeste na costa do Nordeste estao associados com o padrao chuvoso. 0 padrao seco e relacionado ao fortalecimento e/ou deslocamento da Alta Subtropical para oeste e intensificacao dos alisios de sudeste. Em altos niveis, no padrao seco, observa-se que o escoamento e mais zonal e menos intenso sobre a America do Sul e no padrao chuvoso o escoamento e mais intenso sobre latitudes subtropical da America do Sul. ABSTRACT: The atmospheric circulation features associated with the precipitation variability during the main rainy period (NDJ) of the south region of Northeast are determined through the ACP, Cluster Analysis and analysis of extreme precipitation events. Daily precipitation data, NCEP reanalysis, OLR and TSM data are used. The meteorological summer systems of South America, as well as the phenomena associated with their variability, such as ENSO, 30-60 days oscillation and wavetrain patterns over the Pacific Ocean and South America are identified. Positive (negative) anomalies of precipitation in the south region of Northeast are related to the positive (negative) phase of ENSO. In the intraseasonal scale there is a connection among the variability of the SACZ, the SPCZ and the upper cyclonic vortex of Northeast. It is pointed out that the wet pattern is related to the shift of the SACZ northward and the SPCZ eastward and also to the tropical upper cyclonic vortex situated over the Atlantic Ocean. The dry pattern is associated with the SACZ displaced southwards and the tropical upper cyclonic vortex either close or over the continent. The rainy patterns are associated with intense convection over the cast region of Amazon, shift of the Bolivian High to the east, flow at low levels from the Amazon to the south region of Northeast and intensification of the northeast trade winds over the northern coast of South America. In the dry patterns the Bolivian High is displaced to the west of its climatological position, there is flow from Amazon region to the south and weakness of the trade winds on the north coast of South America. Over the South Atlantic Ocean the shift of the Subtropical High eastward and weakness of the southeast trade winds over the Northeast coast are associated with the rainy pattern. The dry pattern is related to strength and/or shift of the Subtropical High to west and intensification of the southeast trade winds. At high levels the westerlies are more intense at subtropical latitudes over South America in the wet pattern than in the dry pattern

   83:  Os estudos dos anÇis de crescimento de †rvores s∆o, em sua maioria, realizados para verificar ou determinar os fatores clim†ticos, que est∆o atuando num local ou regi∆o, provocando variaá‰es nas espessuras de anÇis de crescimento. Poucos estudos s∆o feitos para se verificar e/ou determinar os fenìmenos geof°sicos, que possam causar variaá‰es nas espessuras de anÇis de crescimento de †rvores. Apresenta-se um novo mÇtodo interativo de an†lise de imagens na determinaá∆o das espessuras dos anÇis de crescimento de †rvores, para a procura de periodicidades devidas Ö atividade solar e/ou outros fenìmenos geof°sicos que estejam influenciando o crescimento dos anÇis. O mÇtodo consiste na utilizaá∆o de um computador, um digitalizador de mesa de alta resoluá∆o e na utilizaá∆o de um programa desenvolvimento no ambiente Interactive Data Language (IDL 5.0) para o estudo das imagens digitalizadas dos anÇis de crescimento. A principal vantagem deste mÇtodo Ç a an†lise interativa de imagens dos anÇis de crescimento de †rvores  sem a necessidade de aparelhos complexos de alto custo. Foram coletadas no total 39 amostras, sendo que 12 s∆o de Conc¢rdia - SC, 09 de Canela - RS, 14 de S∆o Francisco de Paula - RS, uma de Nova Petr¢polis - RS, 02 de S∆o Martinho da Serra - RS e uma do Chile. Nas sÇries temporais da espessura dos anÇis de crescimento s∆o aplicadas funá‰es de ajustes, a fim de se obter a melhor curva que represente as tendàncias de longos per°odos associadas ao ritmo de crescimento de cada sÇrie, na qual Ç efetuado o procedimento da padronizaá∆o, atravÇs do qual Ç obtido o °ndice da espessura dos anÇis de crescimento das †rvores. Nas an†lises espectrais foram utilizados os mÇtodos da m†xima entropia e da regress∆o iterativa. Os resultados obtidos pelas an†lises espectrais mostram periodicidades pr¢ximas aos ciclos solares de 11 anos, de Hale, e do segundo harmìnico do ciclo de 11 anos em 5,5 anos para todos os locais de coleta. TambÇm se encontrou periodicidades pertencentes aos ciclos solares de 52 anos e Gleissberg, para as amostras de Conc¢rdia - SC e na Cordilheira da Costa de Osorno - Chile. TambÇm se observou eventos do El Ni§o para per°odos em torno de 4 e 7 anos. ABSTRACT: Tree ring studies are usually used to determine or verify climatic factors which prevail in a given place or region and may cause tree ring width variations. Few studies are dedicated to the geophysical phenomena which may underlie these tree ring width variations. In order to look for periodicities which may be associated to the solar activity and/or to other geophysical phenomena which may influence tree ring growth, a new interactive image analysis method to measure tree ring width was developed and is presented here. This method makes use of a computer and a high resolution flatbed scanner; a program was also developed in Interactive Data Language (IDL 5.0) to study ring digitized images and transform them into time series. The main advantage of this method is the tree ring image interactive analysis without needing complex and high cost instrumentation. Thirty-nine samples were collected: 12 from Conc¢rdia - S. C., 9 from Canela - R. S., 14 from S∆o Francisco de Paula - R. S., one from Nova Petr¢polis - R. S., 2 from S∆o Martinho da Serra - R. S. e one from Chile. Fit functions are applied to ring width time series to obtain the best long time range trend (growth rate of every tree) curves and are eliminated through a standardization process that gives the tree ring index time series from which is performed spectral analysis by maximum entropy method and iterative regression. The results obtained show periodicities  close to 11 yr, 22 yr Hale solar cycles and 5.5 yr for all sampling locations 52 yr and Gleissberg cycles for Conc¢rdia - S. C. and Chile samples. El Ni§o events were also observed with periods around 4 e 7 yr.

   83:  Este trabalho descreve o desenvolvimento de uma nova metodologia para estimar o °ndice de cobertura de nuvens. O mÇtodo emprega uma base de dados obtida em superf°cie, atravÇs de uma cÉmara digital com sensor tipo Charge Coupled Device (CCD), na faixa de radiaá∆o do vis°vel e aquisiá∆o de imagens em vermelho, verde e azul (RGB). Para analisar as imagens coletadas foi desenvolvido um algoritmo cuja funá∆o Ç a de classificar os p°xeis, com base em um processo de decis∆o preestabelecido empiricamente por observadores de campo,  determinando, assim, a fraá∆o de cÇu encoberto por nuvens. Para isso foi empregada a transformaá∆o do espaáo de atributos RGB para Intensity, Hue and Saturation (IHS) utilizando a saturaá∆o (S) na separaá∆o dos p°xeis que correspondem a cÇu e a nuvens. A metodologia foi testada com imagens coletadas na Estaá∆o Ant†rtica Brasileira Comandante Ferraz. Os resultados obtidos com a aplicaá∆o do algoritmo desenvolvido sobre essas imagens mostram que a tÇcnica usada Ç adequada para o trabalho proposto. A validaá∆o da metodologia foi realizada por comparaá∆o com os dados oriundos da inspeá∆o visual do cÇu no local e das respectivas imagens obtidas. Foram testados 2 blocos com 25 imagens, representando cenas de cÇu claro e encoberto e um bloco com 29 imagens referentes a cÇu parcialmente encoberto. O percentual de acerto para os p°xeis das imagens do grupo classificado visualmente como cÇu claro ficou entre 94

   83:  , para o grupo de cÇu classificado como totalmente encoberto entre  99,96
   83:   e 100
   83:  . O percentual de acerto para cÇu parcialmente encoberto apresenta uma grande dificuldade de validaá∆o pela pr¢pria caracter°stica subjetiva do processo de identificaá∆o visual, normalmente empregado nas estaá‰es meteorol¢gicas. Portanto, a avaliaá∆o dos resultados da classificaá∆o autom†tica realizada pelo mÇtodo, foi obtida pela an†lise de "estudo de casos" (case studies) com base em diversos estados de cobertura do cÇu. Esses casos foram escolhidos de forma a representar: (1) padr‰es de cobertura de nuvens no cÇu bem definidos (contornos das nuvens bem definidos) e; (2) cÇu com padr‰es pouco definidos e grande quantidade de nebulosidade (bordas de nuvens pouco definidas e/ou estados de cobertura indefinidos). Para essas condiá‰es, o programa de reconhecimento tambÇm exibe resposta coerente com o processo subjetivo de classificaá∆o baseado na inspeá∆o visual. Foram classificadas pelo mÇtodo  imagens, coletadas para diferentes valores de angulo zenital e de estados de cobertura de nuvens. O algoritmo de classificaá∆o dividiu os resultados em tràs casos distintos: (1) efetivamente nuvens (11
   83:   a 82,93
   83:  ); (2) estado indefinido (10
   83:   a 23,41
   83:  ) e (3) cÇu claro (13,82
   83:   a 85,32
   83:  ). Todos os grupos foram testados com  n°vel de confianáa de 99,73
   83:  . ABSTRACT: This work describes the development of a new methodology to field-estimate the sky cloud coverage percentage. This method employs as data base digital images collected by a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera, in the visible range of the solar spectra as Red - Green - Blue (RGB) compositions. An algorithm was developed to classify each pixel according to a decision process. This process was derived from empirical methods used by the meteorologists to classify the sky according to its cloud cover status. The method transforms the image attributes from the RGB space to the Intensity - Hue - Saturation (IHS) space. This allows the identification of the pixel contamination by clouds by using the information of the saturation (S) component of the IHS space. This methodology was tested at the Brazilian Antarctic Station, Ferraz(62o 05'S 58o 23',5W). The classification results obtained by applying this new methodology are adequate for the aim of this project, which is the automatic ground determination of the cloud fraction index. The validation of the methodology was made by comparing the results of the method with the field-observation of the sky, and with the RGB images. For the validation process we used two blocks of 25 images each, representing clear-sky, and overcast-sky and one block with 29 images representing images with intermediate sky conditions. The accuracy of the method for clear-sky was between 94
   83:   and 99
   83:  . For overcast conditions, the accuracy was between 99.96
   83:   and 100
   83:  . For intermediate conditions, this validation was somewhat more empirical and was applied to some "case studies". Several cloud sky conditions were selected in order to (1) represent well-defined clouds (sharp boundaries between cloud and clear-sky), and (2) represent sky conditions where the boundaries between clouds and sky were not well defined and/or with random nebulosity or thin clouds. For these two types of skies the classification algorithm yielded three distinct classes of results: (1) effectively clouds (11
   83:   to 82.93
   83:  ); (2) undefined situation (10
   83:   to 23.41
   83:  ); and clear sky (13.82
   83:   to 85.32
   83:  ). All these groups were tested within the level of confidence of 99.97

O conjunto de dados compreende o per°odo de 1988 a 1993, no hor†rio das 12:00 Z e nos n°veis de 1000, 925, 850, 775, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50 e 30 h.Pa. As comparaá‰es mostram claramente as diferenáas e semelhanáas entre as re-an†lises e radiossondagens. As assimilaá‰es conseguiram captar pontos importantes dos perfis verticais das observaá‰es como a altura da tropopausa, atravÇs dos dados de temperatura, as mudanáas de direá∆o do vento, com dados das componentes zonal e meridional do vento, que possuem, Bias entre 0,6-1,5 ms-1. Entretanto os dados de umidade das re-an†lises do ECMWF foram mais elevados do que os das radiossondagens, com diferenáas em torno de 50-70
   83:   entre 400-100 hPa. J† a segunda parte deste trabalho realizou a identificaá∆o da passagem dos Dist£rbios Ondulat¢rios de Leste (DOLs) pela regi∆o de AlcÉntara, no per°odo de 1988 a 1997 utilizando o mÇtodo de mudanáa do sinal da componente meridional do vento, entre as camadas de 850-700, 700-500 e 850-500 hPa, associada com alta Umidade espec°fica. Ap¢s detectados os DOLs, estes foram confirmados por dados independentes de cobertura de nuvens e tambÇm pelos espectros de potància da componente meridional do vento. A an†lise da mudanáa do sinal de V detectou a presenáa de DOLs durante todo o ano com intervalo de tempo de 3-6 dias. Esse mÇtodo revelou 64 eventos na camada de 850-700 hPa, 96 em 700-500 e 100 na camada de 850-500 hPa, onde todos apresentaram alta umidade espec°fica, alÇm de nebulosidade sobre AlcÉntara, com valores em torno de 80

ABSTRACT: A statistical study of the air temperature, relative humity and wind components was undertaken in order to validate the ECMWF reanalysis data using observational rawinsonde data collected at CLA for the period from 1988 to 1993 at 12:00 Z. The meteorological variables are extracted at the levels of 1000, 925, 850, 775, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50 and 30 hPa. The reanalysis was able to capture important points of the vertical profiles of the rawinsondes, mainly the height and the values (air temperature) of the tropopause, and the changes in the wind direction. However the ECMWF reanalysis data showed stronger humidity than the rawinsondes with differences around 50-70
   83:   at 400 and 100 hPa levels. The second part of this work accomplished the identification of the passage of the Easterly Wave Disturbances (EWDs) over the AlcÉntara region, in the period from 1988 to 1997, using the method of signal change of the meridional component of the wind. This methodology was applied to the 850-700, 700-500 and 850-500 hPa in associatin with an increase of the specific humidity. The cases selected of EWDs detection, they were confirmed by independent data of cloud cover and also by the power spectrum of the meridional component of the wind. The analysis of the V detected the EWDs during all over the year, with time interval varying from 3 to 6 days. This method revealed 64 events in the 850-700 hPa layer, 96 in the 700-500 and 100 in the 850-500 hPa layer, where all presented positive anomalies of the specific humidity how much and cloud cover values around 80

   83:  In this work, we consider the problem of two-impulse orbital transfers between non-coplanar elliptical orbits with minimum fuel consumption but with a time limit for this transfer. This time limit imposes a new characteristic to the problem that rules out the majority of transfer methods. Then, we used the equations presented by Eckel and Vinh, add some new equations to consider cases with different geometries, and solved those equations to develop a software for orbital maneuvers. This software can be used in the next missions developed by INPE. The original method developed by Eckel and Vinh was presented without numerical results. Thus, the modifications considering cases with different geometries, the implementation and the solutions using this method are contributions of the present work. The software was tested with success

   83:  The purpose of this work is to investigate a proper model to correct the ionospheric effect using single frequency GPS measurements, which it will be used in the artificial satellite orbit determination taking in account that satellite will be above 1000 km of earth's surface. When the GPS signals are transmitted from GPS satellite to receiver, they propagate through the ionosphere causing errors on the measurements which are the highest one on signal propagation. To achieve the highest possible positioning accuracies form GPS, the ionospheric errors shall be neutralized using some kind of model and/or measurement, and they have to be considered within the adjustment process. Using dual frequency GPS receivers, the ionospheric errors can be almost totally accounted for taking advantage of the ionosphere's dispersive nature. However, this work deals with real-time determination of an artificial satellite orbit with single frequency GPS receiver. So, some model of single frequency ionospheric correction must be used. Such investigation will define to which extent the ionospheric error can affect the final accuracy of the real-time determination when using the GPS constellation

   83:  The main goal of this work is to investigate simplified models to determine in real time the orbit of an artificial satellite, using single frequency GPS measurements. This model should be compact providing standard precision at low cost. Cowell's method has been used to propagate the orbit state vector. The modeled forces are geopotential up to 23 rd order and degree of the spherical harmonic coefficients. To propagate the state covariance matrix, it has been considered a more simplified model than the one used in dynamical model. For computing the state transition matrix, it is considered only keplerian motion. To estimate an orbit in real time the extended Kalman filter has been used throughout this paper. Many tests are carried out starting from the simplest two body model and varying the contribution sources of the errors to be considered. In order to assess the results, the estimated orbit for several cases is compared with a full reference Kalman filter, for the Topex/Poseidon satellite

   83:  This paper has the goal of developing a semi-analytical study of the perturbation caused in a spacecraft by a third body involved in the dynamics. One of the important applications of the present research is to calculate the effect of Lunar and Solar perturbations on high-altitude Earth satellites. There is a special interest to see under which conditions a near-circular orbit remains near-circular. The so called "critical angle of the third-body perturbation," that is a value for the inclination such that any near-circular orbit with inclination below this value remains near-circular, is discussed in detail

   83:  In this paper the problem of spacecraft orbit transfer with minimum fuel consumption is considered. The main goal is to develop and implement an algorithm that solves the problem of bi-impulsive three-dimensional orbital transfer. After a search in the literature and analysis of the results available, one selects a method developed by Altman and Pistiner to be the base of the algorithm developed. Their method has the goal of solving the minimum fuel consumption between two fixed positions in space. In the present paper this method is extended to solve the problem of bi-impulsive transfer between two noncoplanar orbits. The spacecraft is supposed to be in Keplerian motion controlled by the thrusts, that are assumed to be impulsive. Results of simulations are presented. The proposed algorithm has two useful characteristics: i) it allows an easy handling of constraints in the region of the orbit that the thrust can be applied, what can be used to avoid burning when the satellite is not visible from the ground stations; ii) it can easily balance between the accuracy of the solution and the time required for solving the problem, what makes it suitable for on-board implementation in an autonomous satellite

   83:  The swing-by maneuver uses a close approach with a celestial body to modify the velocity, energy and angular momentum of a spacecraft. The literature has several papers studying this problem, usually using a patched-conic approximation. In the present paper the swing-by maneuvers are studied and classified under the model given by the three-dimensional restricted three-body problem. To show the results, the orbits of the spacecraft are classified in four groups: elliptic direct, elliptic retrograde, hyperbolic direct and hyperbolic retrograde. Then, the modification in the orbit of the spacecraft due to the close approach is shown in plots that specify from which group of orbits the spacecraft is coming and to which group it is going. The results generated here are used to solve optimal problems, such as finding trajectories that satisfy some given constraints (such as achieving an escape or a capture) with some parameters being extremized (position, velocity, etc ...). Three optimal problems are solved in this paper to show this application

The gravitational capture is a temporary phenomenon, so it cannot explain the existence of the natural satellites alone. It is necessary other process to complete the capture. But the process of the gravitational capture can be used in astrodynamics as a method to reduce the fuel consumption in a transfer maneuver between two celestial bodies. With this aim, and because the gravitational capture is still not completely known, it is proposed in this paper the study of some particularities of the gravitational capture. Discontinuities that appear in the limit between the capture and non-capture trajectories are discussed and explained. Some trajectories are shown as examples. It is also explained why some discontinuities occur in the entry position angle when the velocity of the capture is reduced. Finally, the forces involved in this problem are studied and more explanations about the phenomenon appear. This study will be performed using the model given by the restricted three-body problem and the relation of the capture velocity with the two-body energy is used as the initial condition

   83:  The study of atmospheric maneuvers for satellites is an important aspect of the exploration of planets surfaces and atmospheres. To take more advantage of the gains due to atmospheric maneuvers, we need to develop an optimal control law to maneuver the satellite. This control law should minimize the fuel consumption required by the velocity variation due to engines on board the satellite. With this in mind, the aim of the present work is to establish what is the performance gain that can be achieved using aerodynamic forces combined with propulsive ones, with the objective of changing a satellite orbital plane around the Earth. Results of several simulations are presented

   83:  In the present paper we study and classify the Swing-by maneuvers that use the planet Jupiter as the body for the close approach. The goal is to simulate a large variety of initial conditions for those orbits and classify them according to the effects caused by the close approach with Jupiter in the orbit of the spacecraft. The well-known planar restricted circular three-body problem is used as the mathematical model. The equations are regularized (using Lemaåtre's regularization), so it is possible to avoid the numerical problems that come from the close approach with Jupiter. After that, the velocity increment required to start or to stop the spacecraft at the Earth and the flight path angle at the meeting point are calculated. A section is also written to compare the results obtained with the dynamics given by the restricted problem and the "patched-conics" approximation

   83:  In the main asteroid belt, the Kirkwood gap associated to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter has been largely studied during the lasts decades. The studies suggest that objects in such resonance would suffer very large variations in their eccentricities becoming inner planet crossers, and finally, being removed by close encounters with such planets. Following the ideas of celestial mechanics of gravity assist we present a simple analytical analysis of the variation of some orbital elements of fictitious asteroids in 3:1 resonance with Jupiter after having a close encounter with planet Mars. The results indicate that Mars is not much effective in removing these asteroids

   83:  In this paper we present the first part of a Monte-Carlo analysis of nonimpulsive orbital transfers under thrust errors. This was done as part of an extensive study conducted in three phases. The first phase was the numerical implementation and numerical tests of a nonimpulsive trajectory optimization method. The second phase was an extensive Monte-Carlo analysis on nonimpulsive orbital transfers under thrust errors. The third phase was a first algebraic explanation for some of the numerical relations found in the second phase. This paper emphasizes the first (uniform) part of the second phase. Its main results suggest and partially characterizes the progressive deformation of the trajectory distribution along the propulsive arc, turning 3sigma ellipsoids into banana shaped volumes curved to the center of atraction (we call them "bananoids") due to the loss of optimality of the actual (with errors) trajectories with respect to the nominal (no errors) trajectory. Such deformations can not be anticipated by covariance analysis on linearized models with zero mean errors which propagate ellipsoids into ellipsoids always centered in the nominal (no errors) trajectory. The results also characterize how close or how far are Monte-Carlo analysis and covariance analysis for those examples

   83:  In this work the problem of a spacecraft bi-impulsive transfer between two given non coplanar elliptical orbits, with minimum fuel consumption, is solved considering a non-Keplerian force field (the perturbing forces include Earth gravity harmonics and atmospheric drag). The problem is transformed in the Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). It is developed and implemented a new algorithm, that uses the analytical expressions developed here. A dynamics that considered a Keplerian force field was used to produce an initial guess to solve the TPBVP. Several simulations were performed to observe the spacecraft orbital behaviour by different kind of perturbations and constraints, on a fuel consumption optimization point of view

   83:  Data available on sporadic E layers in ionograms, from 1975 to 1995 over Fortaleza (38 degree W, 4 degree S) in Brazil are analysed as an extension of a previous study to examine permanent changes in the occurrence characteristics of the different types of Es layers. The so called q type Es produced by plasma instability (type II) process of the equatorial electrojet and the other types of Es produced by wind/wind shear mechanism are studied separately. The results show that while the occurrence of the former variety steadily decreased during the period of analysis, the latter type showed marked increases. These characteristics are shown to be associated mainly with the steady drift of the magnetic equator to northward of Fortaleza at a rate of  0.2 degree per year. The long term trends are, however, modulated by solar activity cycle in F10.7 flux. Also there is a suggestion of a possible effect from the June 1991 Pinatubo volcanic eruption. The competing roles of the neutral winds and electric fields in the formation of the low latitude sporadic E layer is demonstrated

   83:  Results of Fabry-Perot interferometer determinations of near-equatorial thermospheric temperatures and winds are presented for the late September and early October 1996 period. Measurements were made from Arequipa, Peru (16ß S) and from S∆o JosÇ dos Campos, Brazil (23ß S). The thermospheric temperatures during the night (19 h-05h LT) at S∆o JosÇ averaged 915 K, with a measurement uncertainty of +- 75 K, some 180 K higher than MSIS-83 predictions. There is evidence in the data of the midnight temperature enhancements seen in other measurements. At both Arequipa and S∆o JosÇ, the meridional component of the thermospheric winds was generally poleward (southward) in the early night, became equatorward (northward) after 21-22h LT, reached a maximum velocity of - 40- 100 m/s near local midnight, then decreased to zero and became poleward after 02-03h LT. The zonal wind component was eastward after 19h LT. reached a maximum of 100-150 m/s at 22h LT and decreased thereafter. Substantial day-to-day variability and convergence effects were seen in the Arequipa wind determinations. The poleward-equatorward- poleward change in the meridional wind component at the two stations agrees with the midnight pressure bulge model of Mayr et al.., but the S∆o JosÇ winds are about half the model values. The Arequipa meridional winds are consistent with the AE-E satellite results and mirror the behavior measured at Kwajalein Atoll during the 1977 solar minimum. The eastward zonal flow at both stations agrees in magnitude with the average of the DE satellite data, but only the S∆o JosÇ data clearly exhibit the double-humped shape noted in the DE data

   83:  Ionosonde measurements are used to study the effects of magnetic activity on spread F and on the postsunset enhancement (Vzmax) of the F region vertical plasma drift at two longitudinally separated stations, Fortaleza and Huancayo, situated along the magnetic equator, in the American sector. during a period of high solar activity. The analysis is made for three different levels of magnetic activity. It is seen that, during the winter, Vzmax and the range spread F occurrence (RSFO) in the premidnight hours systematically increase with Kp at both locations. During the summer and equinoxes the RSFO decreases with magnetic activity in the premidnight hours and increases in the postmidnight hours, the increase being generally more pronounced during very disturbed periods. On the other hand Vzmax deduced from ionosonde measurements shows almost no variation with magnetic activity during equinoxes and summer although during individual months of those periods both increases and decreases are seen. With the help of theoretical model calculations for the electrodynamical coupling between the equatorial E and F regions it is shown that a disturbance F region dynamo associated neutral wind could account for the variations of Vzmax with magnetic activity, that are consistently observed during winter months. On the other hand, competing influences of penetration electric fields, and/or those of disturbance meridional winds, seem to mask the expected gross effect of zonal winds in the summer and equinoctial months

   83:  A network of ionospheric diagnostic instruments was operated on a world wide basis during the October 5-13, 1984 SUNDIAL campaign. The network provided a unique opportunity for a truly multiple technique global analysis of the equatorial-low latitude ionospheric behaviour during the campaign period. The SUNDIAL equatorial-low latitude data set included electric field and spread F data from Jicamarca radar. ionosonde data from 15 stations and magnetograms from 5 stations operated in the American, African. Asian and Indian sectors. Also included are data from electronic polarimeters at Brazilian low-latitude sites. The data analysis has focused attention on the global scale steady state ionospheric behaviour and its predictability by global theoretical model of Sojka and Schunk (1985) and by the International Reference Ionospheric (IRI). The results are suggestive of the need to modify existing quiet time electric field and neutral wind models in varying degrees for different longitude sectors. The analysis also concerns global scale ionospheric transient behaviour in response to exo-ionospheric variabilities under disturbed conditions, in an approach towards a better understanding of the factors that effect short-term prediction schemes. Among the important outcomes of this study is the possibility of using longitude chains of equatorial region ionosondes (and magnetometers) for investigation of equatorial ionospheric response to magnetospheric electric field penetration events and disturbance dynamo effects

   83:  During the period 5-13 October 1984 a coordinated solar-terrestrial data base was acquired to develop a comprehensive understanding and an associated predictive capability for the cause-effect relationships which control the global-scale ionosphere. The effort, the first in a series of continuing investigations :n a program called SUNDIAL, combined modelling of the ionospheric, magnetospheric, and thermospheric domains with a measurements activity that included a network of ionospheric monitoring stations at high-, middle-, and low latitudes in the American, European/African, and Asian/Australian sectors. Solar, solar wind, interplanetary, and geomagnetic data were also obtained through the NOAA Space Environment Services Center. The period began with nearly two full days of typically quiescent solar minimum conditions, with the night of the 6th marking a transition to a substantial increase in solar wind velocities, and enhanced dynamics in the interplanetary magnetic field with associated geomagnetic disturbances. The increased solar wind velocities resulted from a corotating high-speed stream coupled to a transequatorial solar coronal hole. Evidence points to a step-wise coupling of processes from the coronal hole through the interplanetary and magnetospheric domains down to the equatorial ionosphere, where penetrating electric fields participated in triggering the most disturbed condition of equatorial spread-F ever recorded by the Jicamarca Observatory. The correlation of events also included : (1) enhanced particle precipitation power at high latitudes, (2) an associated cross polar cap potential of 75 kV, and (3) simultaneous global observations of F-region dynamics. In addition, detailed model comparisons with observations of the quiet and disturbed ionosphere point to requirements for improved global specification of thermospheric winds and electric fields. The content of this paper presents an overview of the program. its initial findings, recommendations, and future perspectives

   83:  The upper atmospheric airglow emissions, OI 557.7 nm, NaD 589.3 nm, OH (9,4) and O2 atmospheric (0,1) bands and their rotational temperatures have been measured using ground-based multichannel airglow photometers, one located near the equator at Fortaleza (3.9 S, 38.4 W) and the other at low-middle latitude Cachoeira. Paulista (22.7 S, 45.0 W). Monthly averaged nocturnal variations calculated from the data from 1987 to 1993 were used to study the influence of atmospheric dynamical processes on these emissions. Harmonic analysis revealed that the Cachoeira Paulista data are mainly represented 12 hour period oscillation. Phase differences between the different emissions reveal that the vertical phase velocity is about 4 km/h and the vertical wavelength about 50 km. Fortaleza data on the other f. showed longer period, 24 hours, slow vertical propagation velocity, 1.1 km/h, and short veil wavelength, about 30 km. These facts lead us to conclude that the Cachoeira Paulista data are mainly controlled by the semidiurnal tidal oscillation and the Fortaleza data are controlled by the diurnal tide

Electron-density height profiles from two of the experiments, one daytime, and one nighttime, are representative of quiet equatorial ionospheric conditions whereas for the third experiment the rocket was launched into a nighttime ionosphere that was disturbed by a developing plasma bubble event. Agreement between experimental results and the IRI predictions for the quiet day and night densities varies with height. Comparisons are also made with electron densities obtained from the semi-empirical Low Latitude Ionospheric Model (SLIM)

   83:  During a period of high solar activity (1979/1980), IRI-predicted electron density profiles were compared with measurements made at Fortaleza (Brazil), 2 degrees off the dip equator. A few discrepancies were found. They are attributed mainly to dynamical effects associated with the low latitude E x B electromagnetic plasma drifts and thermospheric neutral winds that are not correctly reproduced in the CCIR numerical maps and in the IRI profile shapes as well. In particular, the dependence on the magnetic declination angle, which strongly affects the electrodynamical plasma motions at low latitudes, is not satisfactorily considered in the models

   83:  With the beginning of space research in Brazil in the early 60's a national commission for space activities was created. This commission took important steps, in parallel, to create a program of education and training activities that was forseen as of critical importance for the maintainance of a desirable to ambitious degree of space activity in the country. Early efforts were, as a first step, in favour of training of Brazilian students in foreign centers of excellence (mostly in the US and Europe), as a means for achieving the potential human resource necessary for eventual development of a national program. Today a large percentage of the needs in the area is met by programs developed inside the country at different institutions, the most notable being the "Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais" -INPE (National Institute for Space Research) at S∆o JosÇ dos Campos, where post graduate courses and training programs are well established. Under-graduate courses in selected areas are provided at some Universities, notably at the University of S∆o Paulo. A brief description of the existing programs and an evaluation of the results being achieved are presented in this paper

An attempt to identify various possible associations of the solar phenomena, for example, the location of coronal holes, the role of eruptive filaments or prominences, and current-sheets with the CMEs is carried out. It is shown that the combined associations of these three play an important role in the occurrence of geoeffective CMEs and also act as a tool to predict the associated geomagnetic activity

   83:  We have analysed, for the first time, the high resolution X-ray images of the solar corona, obtained by the Yohkoh Mission, as non-linear extended systems. To quantify the spatio-temporal complexity in this extended system, we use an asymmetric spatial fragmentation parameter computed from a matrix representing an image. Choosing different spatial scales on the same image, wave numbers are computed from the intensity contours and this yields a fragmentation spectrum. This spectrum is used to analyze the images of a complex transient event obtained by the Soft X-ray Telescope board the Yohkoh satellite. The dynamics of the fine structures of the contours suggests the origin of the observed fragmentation to be localized weak turbulence process occuring in an evolving coronal active region

   83:  Radio observations of the eclipse on November 3, 1994, were carried out at Chapec¢, Brazil by using a decimetric spectrograph having high spectral and time resolution. The light curve shows that: (1) Time variation of the radio flux before the totality was more compared to that after. (2.) During the totality radio emission at 1.5 CHz was observed. Advantage of high spatial resolution ( 3.2 arc sec) possible during solar eclipse enabled us to determine the height of radio emission at 1.5 GHz. (3) Microwave bursts were observed associated with metric Type III-RS bursts. The source size of one of the microwave bursts was  7 arc sec and its physical parameters have been estimated. (4) The time difference between radio and optical contacts suggested for the first time asymmetrical limb brightening at 1.5 GHz

   83:  We report examples of the type III bursts and a patch like emission exhibiting split in frequency observed for the first time. This burst was observed over a frequency range of (1630-1580) MHz lasting for about 15 s, on 15th June, 1991. The separation between the two split components is - 30 MHz and lower split frequency component is less intense compared to the higher split frequency component. These observed characteristics favour the hypothesis of conversion of plasma waves by combinational scattering on upgoing ion-sound waves in a magnetic loop. Emission is assumed to be at fundamental and propagation effect explains, the observed characteristics of the decimetric long lasting split frequency burst. Detailed analysis permits to estimate parameters of the exciter and that of the source sizes

   83:  Altitude profiles of the nocturnal atomic oxygen 557.7 nm and 630.0 nm photoemission rates were calculated based on in-situ ionospheric electron density data obtained frorn a rocket experiment carried out on 31 May 1992, 23:52 LT, at the Brazilian equatorial rocket launching facility AlcÉntara (Geogr. 2 degree 19'S; 44 degree 22'W). The onboard instrumentation utilized for the electron density measurements was a Langmuir plasma probe and the vehicle was a Brazilian Sonda III rocket. Horizontal gradients of the photoemission rates were then calculated at 5 km height intervals based on the trajectory upleg and downleg photoemission rates. The resulting gradients are discussed in this paper. At some height levels these gradients resulted to be very large, namely, over a factor of two. The airglow resulting from the atomic oxygen dissociative recombination is generally assumed to stem from all uniform emitting layer. We show that the integrated airglow intensity, in Rayleighs, along the upleg and downleg portions of the trajectory are seen to differ from each other both for the red (10
   83:   difference) and the green lines ( 50
   83:   difference) which shows that in this case the red line emitting layer is about 5 times closer to uniformity than that of the green line

   83:  Simultaneous observations of F2-layer peak heights, from an ionosonde, and nighttime thermospheric neutral win velocities inferred from measurements of Doppler shifts of the OI  630 nm airglow emission line, using a Fabry-Pertinterferometer, have been carried out at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degree S, 45 degree W, dip latitude 16 degree S), Brazil. The MSIS-86 neutral, density model is used to calculate the F-layer balance heights (H0) due only to diffusion and recombination processes. The observed meridional and zonal wind velocities and H0 are used to estimate variations in the F2-layer pea heights (HM). In this paper we present and discuss results from a comparison between the observed F2-layer peak heights and the estimated HM variations produced by the observed meridional wind velocities along the magnetic field lines

   83:  Measurements of ionospheric F-region peak electron densities, peak heights and atomic oxygen 630 airglow emission column intensities, carried out at a low-latitude station located at Cachoeira, Paulist (22.7 degree S, 45.0 degree W; dip latitude 11.9 degree S), in Brazil, are analyzed and compared with the ionospheric parameters predicted by the SLIM and by the IRI ionospheric models. The MSIS neutral atmosphere model is used with the IRI model to calculate the 630 nm nightglow emission intensities. This comparative analysis considers data representative of the summer, winter and equinox seasons, obtained during the high solar activity period around 1980. Reasonably good agreement is obtained between the local time variations the ionospheric and airglow data, and the IRI model predicted parameter variations, but the SLIM model overestimates the F-region peak heights especially during the late afternoon and nighttime hours. These height discrepancies are explained in terms of the strong longitudinal dependence of the electromagnetic E x B vertical plasma drifts and thermospheric neutral winds, which greatly influences the dynamics of the low-latitude ionospheric plasma and airglow emissions. Due to the importance of the relative alignement condition between terminator and magnetic meridian, with its longitudinal and seasonal dependence, o the vertical plasma drifts around sunset, it is suggested that the SLIM ionospheric model should separately consider the longitudinal zones of positive, negative or zero magnetic declination

Unambiguous ENSO events, defined as those where El Nino existed and both SO and W occurred in the May to' August period, showed a very good association with widespread droughts in Australia. Ambiguous ENSOW events, defined as those where El Nino existed but SO and W were outside the May to August period, were sometimes associated with widespread droughts or floods, but were mostly associated with droughts in some parts and floods in others. A similar conclusion applied to other events involving one or more of EN, SO and W, and also to non-events (none of EN, SO, W or Q. Cold (C) events were mostly associated with widespread floods, but a few were associated with droughts

   83:  We present photometric light curves of T Tauri Stars (TTS) observed in the Southern hemisphere. Our list includes 26 TTS, half of which were discovered by the Pico dos Dias survey (PDS). The majority of the observed PDS stars are weak TTS and present, on average, the low range of variability typical of such stars. We monitored some of the stars for several seasons in order to detect possible changes in rotational modulation. In particular, we find that the classical TTS, AS 216, shows a stable period of 3.12d for three consecutive years (between 1985 and 1987) which then does not reveal itself during the observing season of 1989 and 1990. Coupled with this change during the last two observing seasons is an overall increase in the amplitude of the photometric variability in all colors. We derive photometric periods for 13 previously unmonitored objects, and confirm the previously published rotational period of SY Cha. In addition, we confirm that TW Cha and SZ 82 do riot reveal any signs of periodic modulation

The properties of these four-wave hybrid modulational instabilities are studied using the observed interplanetary parameters

   83:  We have developed a program to map the accretion disk brightness distribution in cataclysmic variables from their eclipse light curves. This program is an alternative implementation of the Eclipse Mapping Method (Horne, 1985), employing penalty function optimization techniques with a conjugate-gradient algorithm. To improve the method's performance when faced with relatively low signal-to-noise (S/N) input data we used the combination of X2 and another statistic (T'), which measures the correlation between the residuals and the inverse of the measured fluxes, as the statistical consistency check. This avoids the occurence of biased residuals in the light curve, present when the X2 statistic alone is used. We applied this method to map the accretion disk brightness in V4140 Sgr (NSV 12615). The analysis of the reconstructed images suggests the existence of an optically thick disk, which presents a temperature distribution with radial dependency very close to the one expected from the standard accretion disk model (T  R -3/4 ). The results are compatible with the scenario proposed for V414O Sgr by Baptista, Jablonski  Steiner (1989), emphasizing the differences  between this system and the ultra-short period eclipsing dwarf novae

   83:  We present the results of an analysis of time-resolved spectroscopy of V617 Sgr, the Wolf-Rayet star WR 109, in the H   and He   ii 4686 region. Radial velocity curves were obtained confirming the orbital period of 4.97 hr found from photometric observations. These curves indicate that the superior conjunction of the line-forming region occurs close to the primary eclipse. Constraints on the stellar masses in this peculiar binary are derived from the emission lines. The orbital behavior of the emission line profiles is analyzed in detail. A Doppler tomography study of the H   and He II   4686 lines is performed, aiming to estimate the locus of line formation in the system. The observations may suggest the presence of an optically thick wind. An extended emission region consistent with a hot spot and free-falling gas is also inferred from our analysis. The observed characteristics, such as the strong intensity of He ii   4686 (He II/H   flux ratio 2.9) and the presence of emission lines of highly ionized elements like N v and O vi not usually seen in normal cataclysmic variables and, in this respect, V617 Sgr is quite similar to the star V Sge

   83:  Twenty-four bright, steep-spectrum far-infrared IRAS point sources, which were originally discussed by Hughes  MacLeod, have been searched for hydroxyl, water, and methanol masers and for formaldehyde absorption features. Distances and spectral types for the stars exciting these masers were estimated using radio continuum, IRAS spectra, and maser velocity data. It is found that 21 of the 24 sources are regions of massive star formation containing stars earlier than type B2. We report the discovery of five new OH masers, one new 6.7 GHz CH   OH maser, and two new 12.2 GHz CH   OH masers toward these IRAS sources. By contrast, no 4.765 GHz excited-OH masers were found toward these sources. This sample contains only star-forming regions; there are no planetary or reflection nebulae or extragalactic sources present, as seen in samples with less extreme IRAS colors

   83:  The performance and measurement accuracy of Na narrowband wind-temperature lidar systems are characterized. Error budgets are derived that include several effects not previously reported, such as power-dependent spectral characteristics in the frequency reference, magnetic-field-dependent oscillator line strengths (Hanle effect), saturation, and optical pumping. It is shown that the overall system uncertainty is dependent on the power, pulse temporal characteristics, and beam divergence of the laser transmitter. Results indicate that even systems with significant saturation can produce accurate measurements, which implies the prospect of continuous daytime wind and temperature measurements on semidiurnal and diurnal time periods

   83:  We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in the regions surrounding Hickson compact groups. Our sample is composed of 17 groups within 9000 km s-1. The spectra were taken at the prime focus of the Tololo 4 m telescope, using the ARGUS fiber-fed spectrograph. From these observations, redshifts were determined for the faint galaxies previously identified by de Carvalho, Ribeiro,  Zepf in the surroundings of the groups. Statistical methods were applied to the resultant catalog in order to determine the kinematical structure of each group. This analysis confirms the idea that the Hickson sample of compact groups contains a wide variety of projection and dynamical configurations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of new spectroscopic surveys around compact groups in order to assess their complete velocity distribution

   83:  Optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 were obtained simultaneously with a continuous UV/EUV/X-ray monitoring campaign in 1994 May. Further optical observations were gathered throughout most of 1994. The radio, millimeter, and near-infrared data show no strong correlations with the higher energies. The optical light curves exhibit flickering of 0.2-0.3 mag on timescales of 1-2 days, superposed on longer timescales variations. Rapid variations of 0.01 mag minute -1, if real, are the fastest seen to date for any BL Lac object. Small (0.2-0.3 mag) increases in the V and R bands occur simultaneously with a flare seen at higher energies. All optical wave bands (UBVRI) track each other well over the period of observation, with no detectable delay. For most of the period the average colors remain relatively constant, although there is a tendency for the colors (in particular, B-V) to vary more when the source fades. In polarized light, PKS 2155-304 showed strong color dependence (polarization increases toward the blue, Pu/PI = 1.31) and the highest optical polarization (U = 14.3
   83:  ) ever observed for this source. The polarization variations trace the flares seen in the UV flux. For the fastest variability timescale observed, we estimate a central black hole mass of <1.5 x 109(10) M , consistent with UV and X-ray constraints and smaller than previously calculated for this object

   83:  We investigate the dynamical properties of the cluster of galaxies A3558 (Shapley 8). Studying a region of 1 deg2  3 Mpc) centered on the cluster cD galaxy, we have obtained a statistically complete photometric catalog with positions and magnitudes of 1421 galaxies (down to a limiting magnitude of B  21). This catalog has been matched to the recent velocity data obtained by Mazure et al. and from the literature, yielding a radial velocity catalog containing 322 galaxies. We analyze the resulting catalog in search of substructure, using different statistical techniques. This analysis shows that the position/velocity space distribution of galaxies hows significant substructure. A central bimodal core, detected previously in a preliminary study by Dantas, de Carvalho,  Capelato and by an analysis of the X-ray emission map by Slezak, Durret,  Gerbal, is confirmed using the adaptive kernel technique and wavelet analysis. We show that this central bimodal substructure is nevertheless composed of a projected feature, kinematically unrelated to the cluster, plus a group of galaxies probably in its initial merging phase into a relaxed core. The cD galaxy's velocity offset with respect to the average cluster redshift, reported earlier by several authors, is completely eliminated as a result of our dynamical analysis. The untangling of the relaxed core component also allows a better, more reliable determination of the central velocity dispersion, which in turn eliminates the  problem" for A3558. The cluster also shows a "preferential" distribution of subclumps coinciding with the direction of the major-axis position angle of the cD galaxy and of the central X-ray emission ellipsoidal distribution, in agreement with the anisotropic merger scenario described by West

   83:  The typical extinction curve for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), in contrast to that for the Galaxy, has no bump at 2175 A and a steeper rise into the far-ultraviolet. For the Galaxy, the interpretation of the extinction, and therefore the dust content of the interstellar medium, has been greatly assisted by measurements of the wavelength dependence of the polarization. Up to the present, no such measurements existed for the SMC. Therefore, to further elucidate the dust properties in the SMC, we have measured, for the first time, linear polarization in five colors in the optical region of the spectrum for a sample of reddened stars. For two of these stars, for which there were no existing UV spectrophotometric measurements, but for which we measured a relatively large polarization, we have also obtained data from the IUE in order to study the extinction. With the help of parameterization, we attempted to correlate the SMC extinction and polarization data. In addition, we performed dust model fits to both extinction and polarization using silicate and graphite, or amorphous carbon spheres and silicate cylinders. The size distribution for the cylinders is taken from a fit to the polarization, and we introduce the notion of volume continuity between this and the silicate sphere size distribution. The main results are (1) the wavelength of maximum polarization,  max in the SMC  max typical of that in the Galaxy, its polarization curve is narrower, its bump is shifted to shorter wavelengths as compared with the Galaxy, and its UV extinction does not conform to the Galactic analytical interpolation curve based on the ratio of total to selective extinction; (3) the "typical," monotonic SMC extinction curve can be best fitted with amorphous carbon and silicate grains; (4) the extinction toward AZV 456 may be explained only by assuming a larger gas-to-dust ratio than the observed N(HI)/A(V) value, with a small amount of the available carbon in graphite form; and (5) from an analysis of both the extinction and polarization data and our model fits, it appears that the SMC has typically smaller grains than those in the Galaxy. The absence of the extinction bump in the SMC generally has been thought to imply a lower amount or even an absence of carbon in solid form in the SMC compared with the Galaxy. Our results show that the size distribution, and not only the carbon abundance, is different in the SMC as compared with the Galaxy. In addition, and contrary to previous findings, another component besides silicates is indeed needed to provide a sizable part of the observed extinction toward the SMC. Using the SMC as a laboratory for studying the solid component of the interstellar medium, we also discuss some of the implications of our results in view of proposed interstellar dust models

   83:  Desde a sua derivaá∆o matem†tica por Einstein in 1916, atÇ os nossos dias, as ondas gravitacionais ainda n∆o foram diretamente observadas. Uma das tÇcnicas mais empregadas e mais competitivas no mundo, para a detecá∆o de ondas gravitacionais na faixa de freqÅància de 50 Hz a 10 z , utiliza uma grande massa s¢lida que entra em ressonÉncia mecÉnica, quando Ç banhada por essas ondas gravitacionais. Acelerìmetros, tambÇm chamados de transdutores eletro-mecÉnicos, aparafusados na superf°cie da massa ressonante, convertem parte da energia mecÉnica de oscilaá∆o da massa ressonante em energia elÇtrica. Este sinal elÇtrico na sa°da do transdutor Ç amplificado por amplificaá∆o de baix°ssimo ru°do e gravado em fita magnÇtica para an†lise posterior. Existem duas classes de transdutores eletro-mecÉnicos: os ativos e os passivos, dependendo se eles s∆o ativados por uma corrente AC ou DC, respectivamente. Os transdutores ativos, tambÇm chamados de paramÇtricos, permitem em princ°pio, medir a fase ou a amplitude do sinal com precis∆o melhor que o limite quÉntico padr∆o estabelecido pelo princ°pio de incerteza de He°senberg. Neste trabalho apresentamos os resultados do funcionamento, a 4,2 K de temperatura, de um transdutor paramÇtrico com circuito supercondutor por n¢s projetado constru°do na Universidade Estadual da Louisiana

   83:  Simultaneous observations of the night airglow OH (6, 2) band emission intensity and rotational temperature, by a sky scanning airglow spectrophotometer, and meteor winds, by a middle and upper atmosphere radar (MU radar), were carried out at Shigaraki (34.9 degree N, 136.1 degree E), Japan, from October 29 to November 11, 1994, as the first phase of a campaign, and from July 25 to July 31, 1995 as the second phase. Horizontal structures in the OH emission intensity and rotational temperature were monitored optically, together with the background wind and its wave induced fluctuations, measured by MU radar. Since the MU radar makes a direct measurement of the vertical wavelength, and the OH spectrophotometer makes a direct measurement of the horizontal wavelength, the two techniques are mutually complementary to determine intrinsic wave parameters. Gravity waves with intrinsic periods of 2 to 9 hours, horizontal wavelengths of 500 to 3000 km and vertical wavelengths of 12 to 75 km were identified. Between the two different observation techniques, there is a reasonable agreement in the inferred wave characteristics

Sunspots showed very weak QBO. The geomagnetic QBO matched very roughly with OBO of stratospheric (50 mb) equatorial zonal winds, which, in turn, seems to be linked with Tropospheric weather cycles

All these are probably due to similar periodicities in cloudiness. LC 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society

The SST and (T - D) had similar periodicities, as expected, the majormost at ca. 4.5 years and other smaller ones in the quasi-biennial and quasi-triennial regions. The stratospheric winds had the most prominent periodicity at ca. 2.17 years (26 months) in the early years, which changed to ca. 2.22 years (26.5 months) in the middle and ca. 2.50 years (30 months) in recent years, and had other minor periodicities. Some of the wind periodicities matched some of the SST, (T- D) periodicities during some intervals, indicating possible partially common origins and/or mutual influences

   83:  Whereas some El Ni§o years are known to be associated with droughts in some parts of the globe, notably India, other El Ni§o do not seem to be effective. Recently, it was observed that Unambiguous ENSOW (El Ni§o years, in which the Southern Oscillation Index minima and Pacific sea surface temperature maxima occurred in the middle of the calendar year) were better associated with droughts. This association was checked for rainfalls in South Asia and China. Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and East Asia (comprising of the People's Republic of China and adjacent regions, including India) showed a good association of Unambiguous ENSOW events with droughts. Thailand, Malaysia and the whole Philippines showed some association; but the northwest Philippines showed opposite results. To find a rational for this criterion, it was checked whether such events were in any way related to the timings of the El Ni§o events. In general, El Ni§os active during the main rainy season (June-September for all India's summer monsoon rainfall) were better associated with droughts. But some events did not fit this pattern. Also, many years not having El Nifios were associated with droughts. Thus, the El Ni§o relationship is not clear-cut and predictions based on the same alone are likely to go wrong more often than not, as in the case of the recent El Ni§o (1997).

   83:  A high performance, all-sky, imaging system has provided data on the evolution and drift motions of F-region depletions above the magnetic dip equator at AlcÉntara, Brazil, (2.3 degree S , 44.5 degree W). Monochromatic images of depletions in the OI(630 nm) nightglow were recorded on eight nights during 1-16 October, 1994, as part of the Guar† campaign. The drift motions of the depletions were typically 80-100 m/s eastward prior to local midnight and reduced to a minimum of 30-50 m/s in the morning hours, in accord with previous observations. However, on October 2-3 and 12-13 the depletions were observed to reverse direction for 60-90 min, achieving westward speeds of  30 m/s before the motion reverted to eastward around 0100 LT and accelerated to 35-45 m/s near dawn. Magnetic activity and other evidence suggests that these reversals in the motion of the airglow depletions probably result from reversals in the F-region dynamo rather than from shifts in the altitude of the shear in the nighttime F-region plasma drift

   83:  The Guar† campaign equatorial spread F rocket was launched from AlcÉntara, Brazil, on 14 October 1994 at 1955 LT (2255 UT) into an active topside spread F event. Spread F plasma irregularities observed up to 822 km altitude correlate well with plumes observed simultaneously with a coherent backscatter radar. Matching 1-10 km features in the rocket and radar data over the altitude range 300-800 km implies an eastward drift speed of 110 m/s, versus 95 m/s at 400-500 km based on radar interferometry. Combining these two measurements implies an average upward drift of 30 m/s for the highest altitude structures. The amplitude difference between low-and high-altitude 10km density structures, if attributed to temporal effects, implies an effective diffusion coefficient (decay time constant) of 500-1000 M2/S (2-4x10-4 s-1), which agrees with previous estimates from other techniques and supports the idea that the decay of spread F turbulence occurs in a scale-independent manner

   83:  Analysis of the globally coherent Pc5 geomagnetic pulsation event of March 24, 1991, from a chain of stations extending from the auroral oval to the equatorial region along the American sector, has shown unequivocal evidence on the enhancement of pulsation amplitude in the narrow equatorial band centered at the dip equator. The fine spatial structure of this equatorial enhancement, documented observationally for the first time, emphasizes the importance of an ionospheric component associated with enhanced Cowling conductivity. The presence of an ionospheric component is also indicated at mid-latitudes by the sharp increase in the amplitude of pulsations, more dominantly in the, Y than in the X component, on the sunward side of the dawn terminator. The sunrise effect also causes a reversal of the sense of rotation of the wave polarization across the dawn terminator. Propagation of the magnetospheric inducted polar electric field to low and equatorial latitudes through the ionosphere is invoked to account for the equatorial enhancement and the sunrise effect seen in these Pc5 pulsations

   83:  Long term trends in the sporadic E-layer occurrences and associated electric fields over the equatorial station, Fortaleza are analysed using 16 years (1975-1990) of ionosonde data. The secular drift of the magnetic equator and hence that of the equatorial electrojet current (EEJ) to northward of Fortaleza has resulted in marked long term changes in the occurrence characteristics of the different types of Es layers: the q-type (arising from electrojet instability processes) and the 1, f, c and h types (resulting from wind/wind shear mechanisms). Systematic decrease in the occurrence rates of the q-type Es, accompanied with increases in the remaining types of Es, was registered from 1975 to 1990, during which period the magnetic equator drifted to north of Fortaleza by 400km. The long term trend manifests competing roles of the equatorial electric field and wind systems, in the generation of the different types of Es layers as a function of the distance from the electrocjet center. The F-layer dynamo electric field is seen to exercise strong control of Es layer formation near sunset. Solar cycle variations, represented by the F10.7cm flux, seems to be present in electrojet intensity and the lower thermospheric wind system

We show that in order that the antenna's modes be decoupled a preferred distribution of the resonators on its surface should be used. We find that either 5, 6, 10 or 16 1, resonators, can be used as long as they are conveniently positioned on the antenna's surface. We calculate and analyze the frequency shift and the signal to-noise ratio of the coupled system for the various distributions studied

   83:  Measurements of the hydroxyl nightglow from the Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) satellite-borne experiment and from ground-based photometers are compared and combined in order to characterize the hydroxyl airglow nocturnal behavior at 23 degree S and the equatorial region. Ground-based observations at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degree S, 45 degree W) and at Fortaleza (4 degree S, 38 degree W) from 1987 to 1994 and WINDII data from March 1992 to January 1994 are selected, and two periods are studied: the March/April equinox and the December/January solstice. The WINDII results for the equinox/solstice difference and for the nocturnal behavior of the vertically integrated emission rate of the hydroxyl nightglow are found to be in very good agreement with the ground-based observations. The WINDII measurements revealed two general characteristics of the hydroxyl nightglow altitude variation at the latitudes above. The hydroxyl nocturnal variations are predominantly occurring below 90 km, and the vertically integrated emission rate and the peak height of the volume emission rate show an inverse relationship with seasonal, latitudinal, and inter annual effects. The interpretation of these results in terms of atmospheric tides is then discussed

   83:  In this paper we reexamine the one-dimensional interaction of electromagnetic and ion acoustic waves in a plasma. Our model is similar to one solved by Rao et al. [Phys. Fluids 26, 2488 (1983) under a number of analytical approximations. Here we perform a numerical investigation to examine the stability of the model. We find that for slightly overdense plasmas, the propagation of stable solitary modes can occur in an adiabatic regime where the ion acoustic electric-field potential is enslaved to the electromagnetic field of a laser. However, if the laser intensity or plasma density increases or the laser frequency decreases, the adiabatic regime loses stability via a transition to chaos. Different asymptotic states are attained when the adiabatic regime no longer exists. In these states the plasma becomes rarefied and the laser field tends to behave like a vacuum field.

   83:  During the last 3 decades, the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased mono-tonically. These are expected to produce warning in the troposphere and cooling at higher altitudes Experimental observations of various atmospheric parameters were examined. It was noted that not all parameters showed monotonic trends. In some cases the trends before and after about 1970-75 were opposite; or. the trends developed only after 1970-75. The reason for this transition needs to be explored. A possible caused could be a more rapid increase of CFC concentrations in recent years. Also. effect of meteorological factors specially sea-surface temperature changes before and after 1975, could be a possible cause. though this, in turn. way be related to increasing levels of greenhouse gases

   83:  For the 120 years (1871-1990), every year was designated as an El Ni§o (EN), or Southern Oscillation (SO), minimum or a combination of these, or none. For all India summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR), unambiguous ENSOW [SO and W (warm events) in the middle of the calendar year] seemed to be best associated with droughts and events of type C (cold events) were best associated with floods. However, some droughts occurred without the presence of EN related events and some floods occurred even in the presence of EN related events. In these cases, other parameters such as Eurasian snow cover or stratospheric wind QBO might have had a larger influence

   83:  During 1959-89, the 12-month running means of 5OhPa zonal winds, the average atmospheric temperatures in the northern and southern hemisphere at four altitude slabs (95OhPa, 850- 300hPa, 300-100hPa and 100,5OhPa), Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and. 30hPa temperatures at North Pole and average for (10 degree-90 degree N), all showed quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO). However, whereas the wind QBO had an average spacing of 29 months, only temperatures at 300-100hPa and Atlantic SST had similar average spacing. Other temperatures as also SO index (represented by Tahiti minus Darwin atmospheric pressure) had larger average spacing. Spectral analysis showed that whereas wind QBO had only one prominent peak at T=2.33 years, other parameters had weak QBOs near T=2.5-2.6 years except Pacific SST and 30hPa North Pole temperature which had small peaks near T=23 years. All the temperatures had prominent peaks in the 3-6 year region which matched with smilar peaks in the SO index. There is some indication that stratospheric wind QBO had some relation with parameters at all altitudes in tropics and with North Pole, while ENSO had considerable influence at other latitudes/altitudes

   83:  The impulsive solar burst of October 28, 1992 showed temporal and spatial fine structures that were observed at 48 GHz with the multi-beam antenna of the Itapetinga Radio Observatory. The relative positions of burst centroids were determined with a spatial accuracy of 2", with a temporal resolution of 1 millisecond. The burst intensity time profile shows fast pulses of about one second duration, superimposed by subsecond time structures. The spatial analysis of the fast pulses suggests that the emission originated from distinct locations, separated by about 5". Our results favour the idea that impulsive solar bursts are a superposition of small elementary events spread both in time and space, probably resulting from discontinuous energy release processes

As caracter°sticas das chuvas no NE setentrional e oriental foram quase similares, mas diferenciam consideravelmente das chuvas no NE meridional. Na regi∆o do OBO, o NE setentrional teve pequenas periodicidades em 2,03 e 2,45 anos, o NE teve fortes periodicidades em 2,26 e 2,60 anos enquanto o NE meridional n∆o leve nenhum significante OBO. O vento zonal equatorial teve o pico mais, forte em 2,33 anos, um pico menor em 2,64 anos e outro ainda menor em  2,00 anos. O °ndice de oscilaá‰es meridional TD (press∆o atmosfÇrica do Taiti, menos em Darwin), teve picos em 2,05 e 2,56 anos enquanto que a EU-SST(temperatura da superf°cie do mar no Pac°fico Oriental Equatorial) leve picos em 2, 10 e 2,57 anos. 0 SST do AtlÉntico Norte e Sul leve picos em (2,10-2,15) anos enquanto o SST na costa NE do Brasil leve pico em 2,29 anos e a tens∆o dos ventos teve picos em 2,20 anos. Na regi∆o QTO, o vento em 50nib teve um pequeno pico em 3,2 anos e a tens∆o de ventos na costa NE leve pico em 3,3 anos. Todos os outros parÉmetros, incluindo todos os 3 °ndices regionais de chuvas no NE do Brasil, tiveram picos significantes pr¢ximos de 3,5 anos. Apareceram tambÇm picos nas faixas de (4,5-5, 0) anos e (9,5-13,9) anos. Todos os tràs °ndices de precipitaá∆o tiveram correlaá∆o moderada com T-D e EEP-SST 0,3) e o vento em 50mb ( 0,4). As correlaá‰es com o SST no AtlÉntico Norte e Sul foram mais altas (0,5) e tambÇm com o SST costal do NE ( 0, 6). A precipitaá∆o do NE oriental leve afia correlaá∆o (0, 5) com a tens∆o de vento costal do NE ABSTRACT: The 12-monthly running means centered 3 months apart (4 values per year) of the rainfalls in NE (Northeast) Brazil were subjected to Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis and results compared with smilar Jar analysis for several other parameters. Characteristics of northern NE and eastern NE rainfalls were almost similar but differed considerably from those of southern NE rainfall. In the QBO region, northern NE had small periodicities at 2.03, 2.45 years, eastern NE had strong periodicities at 2.26, 2.60 years while southern NE had no significant QBO. The 50mb equatorial zonal wind had a strongest peak at 2.33 years, a smaller peak at 2.64 years and a still smaller peak at 2.00 years. The Southern Oscillation Index T-D (Tahiti minus Darwin atmospheric pressure) had peaks at 2.05, 2.57 years while FEP-SST (equatorial eastern Pacific sea surface temperature) had peaks at 2.10, 2.57 years. (North and South Atlantic SST) had peaks at (2.10-2.15) years while NE Brazil coast SST had 2.29 years and Wind Stress had 2.20 years, In the QTO region, 50mb wind had a small peak at 3.2 years and NE coastal Wind Stress at 3.3 years. All other parameters including all the 3 regional rainfalls of NE Brazil had significant peaks near3.5 years. Peaks were also in the (4.5-5.0) year and (9.5-13.9) year bands. All the three rainfalls had moderate correlations with T-D and EEP-SST (0.3) and with 50mb wind ( 0.4). Rainfall correlations were higher with North and South Atlantic SST (0.5) and with NE coastal SST (0.6). The eastern NE rainfall had a high correlation (0.5) with NE coastal Wind Stress

   83:  Sporadic layers of metal atoms (Ns), occurring in the same height range as ionospheric sporadic-E layers, were first detected by lidar some 20 years ago. Ns layers have typical thicknesses of a few hundred meters to a few km, peak atom concentrations several times that of the ambient background layer, and are sometimes seen to grow and decay over time scales as short as a few minutes. Layers have been detected in Na, Fe, K and Ca, but it seems likely that they exist in other meteoric metals such as Mg. Despite a great deal of excellent experimental work over the past decade, the source of Ns layers is still an open question. Mechanisms suggested include direct meteor deposition, release from aerosol particles, chemical reduction of appropriate metal compounds, redistribution of existing atoms, and recombination of ions. The last-named of these mechanisms, although capable of explaining many of the observed characteristics of Ns layers, including their strong correlation with Es, has generally been rejected in the past, at least in the case of Na, because mass spectrometer measurements of Na+ have mostly shown concentrations too small to explain the observed sporadic sodium layers. However, recent laboratory measurements of the relevant recombination processes, and a re-evaluation of the rocket-borne mass-spectrometer measurements, suggest that ion recombination is in fact the strongest contender

The mean overestimation of solar irradiance by BRASIL-SR clear sky model was up to 2.5 times larger than that found outside the region of biomass burnings. Within the region of biomass burnings the overestimation was over 5 times larger at the peak of the burning season when compared to the rest of the year. A positive correlation between combustion products and the number of fire spots counted by satellite technique suggests a possible method for the parameterization of these effects in radiation transfer models

   83:  In recent years, scientists have used wide-angle imaging observations of F-region nightglow emissions (e.g., OI630 nm and OI777.4 nm) to map the F-region equatorial ionospheric irregularity structures, characterized by large scale plasma depletions, generally known as transequatorial plasma bubbles. In Brazil, an OI630 nm all-sky imaging system has been in operation at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degrees S, 45.0 degrees W) since March 1987. This has provided an extensive data-base of the OI630 nm all-sky imaging observations in the equatorial ionospheric anomaly region. In this paper, the morphology of large scale equatorial F-region plasma depletions under sunspot maximum and minimum conditions is presented and discussed. It has been observed that the occurrences of plasma depleted regions are relatively lesser during low solar activity than during high solar activity. The seasonal occurrence pattern is fairly similar for high and low solar activities

   83:  The understanding of post-sunset zonal drifts of ionospheric plasma depletions in the equatorial and subequatorial regions are of importance to the knowledge of the electrodynamics of the nocturnal ionosphere. Drifts occurring over the low latitude station Cachoeira Paulista - CP (Geogr. 22 degrees 41' S, 45 degrees 00', dip 29 degrees for the epoch of 1985) during the October and March time frames are analyzed for the period of 1980 -1992. That analysis is based upon about 650 days of zonal scanning photometer measurements of the nocturnal OI 630 nm airglow. The zonal motions of valleys of the OI630 nm intensity are used to infer the eastward plasma velocity variations with local time. In this way, the velocity variations with solar activity and magnetic activity are studied. The mean trend in the velocity local time variation is a decrease from early evening to post-midnight hours, as expected in view of the F-region vertical electric fields, naturally decreasing magnitudes after sunset due to recombination. The zonal velocity decay between 21 LT and 02 LT faster during the period of maximum solar activity than during the solar minimum period

   83:  Methane (CH4) concentrations have been measured in the lower atmosphere in Brazil on board a Brazilian research aircraft. Air samples were obtained at different heights by grab sampling, and taken for analysis by flame ionization detector (FID) gas chromatography at INPE (the Brazilian Institute for Space Research). The sampling region is the cerrado area of central Brazil, around the cities of Brasilia, Cuiaba, Alta Floresta, and Porto Nacional. Instead of concentrating on plume characteristics, an effort was made to describe the average mixed atmosphere, keeping a distance from direct burning sources. The measurements of atmospheric CH4 during the dry season have shown larger mixing ratios compared to the wet season. This finding has consistently been observed for different dry seasons, but especially for the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation: Brazil (SCAR-B) field mission. For comparison, measurements near the ground in a region not directly affected by biomass burning (Natal, Brazil) show concentrations that are 39 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) less than the biomass burning results, which is 4 times the size of the seasonal amplitude at oceanic stations within about 10 degrees of the equator, thus making the biomass burning values comparable to those observed at northern hemisphere midlatitudes. The vertical distribution for these regions seems to be well mixed, showing differences of about 40 ppbv between the different sampling areas of the SCAR-B experiment. The CH4 mixing ratio was in general well correlated with the CO mixing ratio

   83:  The Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) field project took place in the Brazilian Amazon and cerrado regions in August-September 1995 as a collaboration between Brazilian and American scientists. SCAR-B, a comprehensive experiment to study biomass burning, emphasized measurements of surface biomass, fires, smoke aerosol and trace gases, clouds, and radiation, their climatic effects, and remote sensing from aircraft and satellites. It included aircraft and ground-based in situ measurements of smoke emission factors and the compositions, sizes, and optical properties of the smoke particles; studies of the formation of ozone; the transport and evolution of smoke; and smoke interactions with water vapor and clouds. This overview paper introduces SCAR-B and summarizes some of the main results obtained so far. (1) Fires: measurements of the size distribution of fires, using the 50 m resolution MODIS Airborne Simulator, show that most of the fires are small (e.g., 0.005 km(2)), but the satellite sensors (e.g., AVHRR and MODIS with 1 km resolution) can detect fires in Brazil which are responsible for 60-85
   83:   of the burned biomass; (2) Aerosol: smoke particles emitted from fires increase their radius by as much as 60
   83:   during their first three days in the atmosphere due to condensation and coagulation, reaching a mass median radius of 0.13-0.17 mu m; (3) Radiative forcing: estimates of the globally averaged direct radiative forcing due to smoke worldwide, based on the properties of smoke measured in SCAR-B (-0.1 to -0.3 W m(-2)), are smaller than previously modeled due to a lower single-scattering albedo (0.8 to 0.9), smaller scattering efficiency (3 m(2) g(-1) at 550 nm), and low humidification factor; and (4) Effect on clouds: a good relationship was found between cloud condensation nuclei and smoke volume concentrations, thus an increase in the smoke emission is expected to affect cloud properties. In SCAR-B, new techniques were developed for deriving the absorption and refractive index of smoke from ground-based remote sensing. Future spaceborne radiometers (e.g., MODIS on the Earth Observing System), simulated on aircraft, proved to be very useful for monitoring smoke properties, surface properties, and the impacts of smoke on radiation and climate

   83:  About 1.1 million cloud-to-ground lightning flashes were recorded by a lightning positioning and tracking system in southeastern Brazil in 1993. The 1-year continuous lightning data set is the first obtained in Brazil. It has been analyzed for geographical distribution of total flash density, percentage of positive flashes, negative and positive flash densities, and negative and positive flash peak currents. The dependence of the flash density and peak current on latitude, altitude. and soil resistivity was investigated. Negative flash peak current was found to be inversely correlated with latitude, but no other significant correlation was found for flash density and peak current with these parameters. Positive flashes were found to be contaminated by intracloud flashes. The maximum total, negative, and positive flash densities were 15.5, 9.1, and 7.7 flashes/km(2) per year, respectively. The average percentage of positive flashes was 36.5
   83:  . The geometric means of negative and positive peak current were 30.9 kA and 17.8 kA. The high density, high percentage and low average peak current of positive flashes found in this study are probably a result of such a contamination. Neglecting positive flashes below 15 kA, assuming that they correspond to intracloud flashes erroneously identified by the system, the maximum positive and total flash densities would be 3.9 flashes/km(2) per year and 11.7 flashes/km(2) per year. The percentage and geometric mean peak current of positive flash would be 23
   83:   and 38.7 kA, respectively. The results are discussed in the context of other similar measurements made at different parts of the world

   83:  Measurements of the hydroxyl nightglow from the Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) satellite-borne experiment and from ground-based photometers are compared and combined in order to characterize the hydroxyl airglow nocturnal behavior at 23 degrees S and the equatorial region. Ground-based observations at Cachoeira Paulista (23 degrees S, 45 degrees W) and at Fortaleza (4 degrees S, 38 degrees W) from 1987 to 1994 and WINDII data from March 1992 to January 1994 are selected, and two periods are studied: the March/April equinox and the December/January solstice; The WINDII results for the equinox/solstice difference and for the nocturnal behavior of the vertically integrated emission rate of the hydroxyl nightglow are found to be in very good agreement with the ground-based observations. The WINDII measurements revealed two general characteristics of the hydroxyl nightglow altitude variation at the latitudes above. The hydroxyl nocturnal variations are predominantly occurring below 90 km, and the vertically integrated emission rate and the peak height of the volume emission rate show an inverse relationship with seasonal, latitudinal, and inter annual effects. The interpretation of these results in terms of atmospheric tides is then discussed

   83:  We use radar observations from the Jicamarca Observatory from 1968 to 1992 to study the effects of the F region vertical plasma drift velocity on the generation and evolution of equatorial spread F. The dependence of these irregularities on season, solar cycle, and magnetic activity can be explained as resulting from the corresponding effects on the evening and nighttime vertical drifts. In the early night sector, the bottomside of the F layer is almost always unstable. The evolution of the unstable layer is controlled by the history of the vertical drift velocity. When the drift velocities are large enough, the necessary seeding mechanisms for the generation of strong spread F always appear to be present. The threshold drift velocity for the generation of strong early night irregularities increases linearly with solar flux. The geomagnetic control on the generation of spread F:is season, solar cycle, and longitude dependent. These effects can be explained by the response of the equatorial vertical drift velocities to magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbance dynamo electric fields. The occurrence of early night spread F decreases significantly during equinox solar maximum magnetically disturbed conditions due to disturbance dynamo electric fields which decrease the upward drift velocities near sunset. The generation of late night spread F requires the reversal of the vertical velocity from downward to upward for periods longer than about half an hour. These irregularities occur most often at similar to 0400 local time when the prompt penetration and disturbance dynamo vertical drifts have largest amplitudes. The occurrence of late night spread F is highest near solar minimum and decreases with increasing solar activity probably due to the large increase of the nighttime downward drifts with increasing solar flux

Also, significant higher periodicities (similar to 4 years) are seen in the mesospheric winds, indicating that QBO and higher periodicities in the midlatitude mesosphere could be highly distorted forms of stratospheric wind QBO and/or may have altogether different origins (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation effects)

   83:  Ozone soundings launched from Cuiaba between August 16 and September 10, 1995, during the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment show an enrichment of tropospheric ozone when compared with average wet season values and also present a great variability in concentrations depending on the dominant circulation pattern. Smoke tracers, such as aerosol optical thickness, measured from a Sun photometer installed at the Institute Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais-Cuiaba site, and black carbon ground measurements, also show an enhancement of smoke during the same period. Although there is a connection between the enrichment of the tropospheric ozone around Cuiaba during the dry season and smoke from biomass burning, the correlation between ozone and smoke indicates different behavior in different periods. Trajectory analyses suggest that the strong ozone peak measured in the period between August 26 and 29, 1995, may be associated not only with direct biomass-burning emissions but also with urban/industrial emissions from big cities on the coast of Brazil and recirculation of old smoke. This view is confirmed by measurements made from the Cloud Lidar System instrument aboard the ER-2 aircraft

   83:  On January 26, 1994, a coordinated campaign was conducted to study the stratospheric conductivity in Brazil. The measurements were obtained, each 10 min, by a double probe electric field detector during a stratospheric balloon flight launched at 0720 LT from Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil (geographic coordinates 22 degrees 44'S, 44 degrees 56'W). The data were supported by radar and Meteosat satellite images. The balloon reached the ceiling altitude of 29.2 km in 1 hour and 20 min after launch and then floated for about 7 hours. For the first time, positive and negative conductivity vertical profiles were obtained in Brazil. During the flight, at an average altitude of 27.5 km, the balloon passed over two thunderclouds as identified by onboard video images and photographs, as well as by radar data. The simultaneous conductivity measurements and thundercloud observations allowed to determine that the presence of clouds affects the stratospheric negative conductivity, producing an extended and cumulative drop after the balloon passed over each cloud. The positive conductivity, in turn, was found to be predominantly influenced by the photoelectric effect

   83:  On December 13, 1989, a coordinated campaign was conducted in Brazil to study the electrical signatures associated with a large storm system over the South American continent. Balloon-borne VLF electric field data showed more than a hundred lightning-related stratospheric vertical electric field (sferics) signatures during approximately 6 hours. The sferic signatures were characterized by a rapid transient with peak amplitudes exceeding 7 V/m which would be expected by the removal of positive charge below followed by a slow recovery. This signature indicates that the lightning strokes experienced by the balloon were either cloud discharges or positive ground discharges. The peak amplitudes indicate that the positively charged region is of the order of tens of coulombs. The recovery curves are quite variable, reflecting the complex nature of the propagating phenomena in the atmosphere. A lightning position and tracking system (LPATS) network recorded 326 ground strokes at distances less than 100 km of the balloon. In contrast with previous observations during the summer in the northern hemisphere it was found that most lightning flashes (60
   83:  ) were positive. In addition, only a small fraction of them occurred simultaneously with a balloon sferic signature, indicating that most balloon sferics were a result of cloud discharges. An analysis of wind and temperature data during the event showed that the predominance of positive ground flashes is apparently not supported by the tilted dipole hypothesis, being necessary to search for other mechanisms to explain it. Although this observation cannot be considered as usual in this region, it clearly indicates that the flash polarity should depend on many factors besides the season. These factors should be probably related to the geographical location and the meteorological environment

   83:  This paper reports on a coordinated campaign conducted in Brazil, December 13, 1989, to study the electrical signatures associated with a large storm system over the South American continent. Inside the storm, large convective cells developed extending up to the tropopause, as revealed from meteorological balloon soundings. Quasi-DC vertical electric field and temperature were measured by zero-pressure balloon-borne payload launched from Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil. The data were supported by radar and GOES satellite observations, as well as by a lightning position and tracking system (LPATS). The analysis of infrared imagery supports the general tendency for lightning strikes to be near to but not exactly under the coldest cloud tops. In turn, the radar maps located the strikes near to but outside of the most intense areas of precipitation (reflectivity levels above 40 dBz). The balloon altitude and stratospheric temperature show significant variations in association with the storm. The quasi-DC vertical electric field remained almost during the whole flight in a reversed direction relative to the usual fair weather downward orientation with values as large as 4 V/m. A simple calculation based on a static dipole model of electrical cloud structure gives charges of some tens of coulombs. In contrast with most electric field measurements in other regions, no indication of an intensification of the vertical field in the downward fair weather orientation was observed. This fact is in agreement with past observations in the South American region and seems to be related to a particular type of storm that would occur with more frequency in this region. If so, such a difference may have an important role in the global atmospheric electrical circuit, considering that South America is believed to give a significant current contribution to the global circuit

ABSTRACT: This work is concerned on the study of evolutionary algorithms, in the solution of problems involving coevolution of agents, whose behavior correspond to finite state machines. The genetic algorithms are the base for the coevolutive process, approaching cooperative and competitive behaviors. The cooperation happens inside of a specific group of agents and the competition happens among these groups. For this study were varied several genetic algorithms' characteristics and the ambient where the interactions among the agents happen. Factors as the representation and control of the population's elements operated by the genetic algorithm, its selection and operation were explored, in way to evaluate which outlines would be more convenient for application in those types of problems. For the attainment of this work, the Swarm simulation system, developed by Santa Fe Institute - USA, was used

ABSTRACT: An experimental study has been conducted with the objective of investigating the effects of acoustic oscillations in the emission rates of nitrogen oxides. The experimental pulse combustor was of the Rijke type, and the fuel was liquified petroleun gas (LPG). The combustor was operated in both oscillatory and non oscillatory conditions, under the same input conditions. Because the fuel does not contain nitrogen, tests were also conducted with ammonia injected together with the fuel, in order to study the formation of NOx from fuel nitrogen

ABSTRACT: A statistical- dynamical zonally symmetric model of primitive equations is used to study the seasonal migration of ITCZ and to simulate the monsoon. Three numerical experiments were performed in the case of ITCZ, with lower boundary: 1) control, 2) global ocean and 3) global continent. All experiments showed tri-cellular mean meridian circulation. The seasonal migration of ITCZ over continent is greater than in the case of aquaplanet, as expected. The ITCZ migrates 25 degree in mean over global continent; on global ocean a migration of the ITCZ is reduced to 15 degree; as in the case of the control. Over global ocean the migration of ITCZ depends on the maximum temperature of the ocean surface. The simulation of Monsoon is due to differential heating of continent relative to the ocean. This experiment considered continent north of the equator and the ocean to the south. The characteristics of monsoon are well simulated (wind reversal and rainfall) when compared with observations. The climatic pattern of the Holocene is simulated, changing earth's orbital parameters and the results show enhancement of monsoon circulation, which agrees with paleoclimatic evidence. When the grid of the model is reduced, from 10 degree to 2,5 degree , the results agree better with the climatological observations. Comparing these results with those obtained with the complex models (GCM), and with a simple model (energy balance), it is observed that our model simulation is reasonable

A spinning flat mirror that is canted relative to its spin axis modulates the direction of beam response in a nearly elliptical path on the sky. The experiment was successfully flown in 1996 February, achieving near laboratory performance for several hours at float altitude. A map free of instrumental systematic effects is produced for a 3.5 hr observation of 630 deg(2), resulting in a flat-band power upper limit of [l(l + 1)C-I/(2 pi)](0.5) < 77 mu K at l = 38(-20)(+25) (95
   83:   confidence). The experiment design, flight operations, and data, including atmospheric effects and noise performance, are discussed

   83:  Photometric and spectroscopic characterization of the V Sge star V617 Sgr (WR 109) is presented. The orbital period, 0.207 day, is the shortest of its class. The optical light curve presents a double wave with minima and maxima of uneven brightness. Strong emission lines of highly ionized species such as HeII, NV and OVI dominate the optical spectrum. High and low photometric states have been observed and the primary eclipse becomes shallower at eruptions. H alpha emission becomes stronger and broader at high state when compared to low state. The striking similarities to V Sge are discussed. The photometric and spectroscopic observations suggest that a high and asymmetric rim exists associated with the accretion disk. This star is interpreted as a X-ray quiet galactic counterpart of the supersoft X-ray binaries seen in the Magellanic Clouds

   83:  In situ measurement of electron density height profile of the equatorial nighttime ionosphere, under a developing spread F event, was carried out using a dual mode high frequency capacitance (HFC) probe that was flown on board a SONDA-III rocket launched from Natal on December 11, 1985. This represents the first measurement of plasma bubble characteristics using an HFC probe. A series of plasma bubbles in varying degrees of their growth phase was detected mostly during the upleg of the flight. A somewhat detailed discussion, and comparative studies, of the measurements at the two probe frequencies (6.17 MHz and 11.75 MHz) are presented in this paper. Among the important findings from the present study is an evidence of electron temperature enhancement in the plasma bubble possibly caused by electron heating from energetic particle precipitation in the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly

   83:  A power spectral analysis of geomagnetic data between June and November 1982 from Vassouras, a low-latitude observatory located in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA), is carried out in order to investigate the origin of multiple peaks commonly observed in the energetic electron spectra in the inner magnetosphere. Comparison with energetic electron observations made by the low-altitude satellite S81-1 during the same time interval [Datlowe et al., 1985] indicates that even it the peaks are due to a quasi-resonance process as Cladis [1966] has suggested, whereby energetic electrons are accelerated and transported radially as a result of magnetic fluctuations with periods comparable to their azimuthal drift periods, the driver of such magnetic fluctuations is not the ionospheric current in the equatorial electrojet, modulated by electron precipitation in the SAMA region, such as Cladis [1966] proposed. We suggest that the source of drift-resonant magnetic fluctuations, if they exist, must instead be sought in the solar wind. Otherwise, the drift-resonant mechanism cannot be viable

   83:  Recent interplanetary observations presented evidence of simultaneous excitation of high-frequency Langmuir waves and low-frequency electromagnetic whistler waves in the magnetic holes of the solar wind. In this letter, we formulate a broadband theory of the interplanetary Langmuir-whistler events. We show that whistler waves can grow exponentially as a result of nonlinear interactions of Langmuir waves and left-hand circularly polarized radio waves. In particular, the growth of whistler waves favors propagation parallel to the Langmuir waves

   83:  Early on March 14, 1989, a thermal plasma probe on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F9 spacecraft detected extensive and dramatic decreases in the ion density at 840 km, near 2130 LT, during two consecutive transequatorial passes over South America. The order of magnitude decreases in the ion density extended more than 4000 km along the satellite track. The depletions were accompanied by upward and westward plasma drifts, both in excess of 100 m/s. Their onsets and terminations were marked by extremely sharp density gradients. DMSP F9 observed no similar depletions over the Atlantic during preceding orbits. A partial depletion was detected over the eastern Pacific during the following orbit. The DMSP F9 ground track passed slightly west of a Brazilian total electron content (TEC) station and two Brazilian ionosondes during the first depletion encounter. The TEC fell far below normal during the night of March 13-14. The ionosonde measurements indicate that, in the hour after sunset, before DMSP passed through the depletions, the F2 layer rose rapidly and disappeared, but at the time of the first depletion encounter, h(m)F2 was decreasing over one of the stations. The DMSP F8 satellite, which orbits in the dawn-dusk meridian, made related measurements on March 13 and 14. Crossing the equator at dust on March 13, at the same longitude where DMSP F9 encountered the first depletion, DMSP F8 detected upward and westward drifts, but it measured extremely large rather then depleted ion densities. During two dawn passes over the eastern Pacific on March 14, DMSP F8 observed depletions somewhat similar to those detected by DMSP F9. Large westward drifts accompanied the depletions detected by DMSP F8. It is quite probable that the morningside depletions detected on March 14 are remnants of those detected earlier by DMSP F9 in the evening sector. We develop a phenomenological model reconciling DMSP F8, F9, and ground-based measurements. Our calculations show that rapid upward drifts sustained for several hours can produce depletions in the equatorial ion density with sharp gradients at their high-latitude boundaries, consistent with the data. We discuss possible contributing mechanisms for generating these upward drifts. These include direct penetration of the magnetospheric electric field to low latitudes, the electric fields generated by the disturbance dynamo, and the effects of conductivity gradients near the dusk terminator and the South Atlantic anomaly

   83:  We have studied the local time and seasonal variations of thermospheric nighttime meridional winds at the low-latitude station, Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil, corresponding to quiet geomagnetic conditions of high solar activity (F10.7 > 150 units). The meridional winds are derived from F layer peak height (h(max)) data using a modified form of the ''servo'' model wherein plasma transport,due to electric field is taken into account. It is found that during the solstices the meridional winds exhibit the transequatorial neutral airflow from the summer to the winter hemisphere, i.e., the nighttime winds are primarily equatorward (poleward) during the December (June) solstice: It is shown that this neutral wind flow pattern is effectively modulated by winds related to equatorial midnight temperature maximum (MTM) and the associated midnight pressure bulge, especially in the December solstice (local summer); The seasonal visibility of the effect of MTM on low/equatorial latitude meridional winds seems to be different in the east Brazil (45 degrees W) and Indian (75 degrees E) sectors

   83:  A high-performance, all-sky imaging system has been used to obtain novel data on the morphology and dynamics of short-period (<1 hour) gravity waves at equatorial latitudes. Gravity waves imaged in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere were recorded in three nightglow emissions, the near-infrared OH emission, and the visible wavelength OI (557.7 nm) and Na (589.2 nm) emissions spanning the altitude range similar to 80-100 km. The measurements were made from, Alcantara, Brazil (2.3 degrees S, 44.5 degrees W), during the period August-October 1994 as part of the NASA/Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais ''Guara campaign''. Over 50 wave events were imaged from which a statistical study of the characteristics of equatorial gravity waves has been performed. The data were found to divide naturally into two groups. The first group corresponded to extensive, freely propagating (or ducted) gravity waves with observed periods ranging from 3.7 to 36.6 min, while the second group consisted of waves of a much smaller scale and transient nature. The later group exhibited a bimodal distribution for the observed periods at 5.18 +/- 0.26 min and 4.32 +/- 0.15 min, close to the local Brunt-Vaisala period and the acoustic cutoff period, respectively. In comparison, the larger-scale waves exhibited a clear tendency for their horizontal wavelengths to increase almost linearly with observed period. This trend was particularly well defined around the equinox and can be represented by a power-law relationship of the form lambda(h) = (3.1 +/- 0.5)tau(ob)(1.06+/-0.10), where lambda(h) is measured in kilometers and tau(ob) in minutes. This result is in very good agreement with previous radar and passive optical measurements but differs significantly from the relationship lambda(h) proportional to tau(ob)(1.5) inferred from recent lidar studies. The larger-scale waves were also found to exhibit strong anisotropy in their propagation headings with the dominant direction of motion toward the similar to NE-ENE suggesting a preponderance for wave generation over the South American continent

   83:  High electron temperature in the equatorial ionization anomaly region detected first by Kyokko satellite and later observed frequently by Hinotori satellite are found to be closely associated with the ionization crests of the anomaly. This phenomenon, called the equatorial electron temperature anomaly, is found to occur predominantly in the equinoctial months and to become enhanced with the increase in solar activity. It is mainly a nighttime phenomenon and shows maximum temperature enhancement at around 2100 LT. Using a theoretical model, a mechanism for its occurrence is presented. The mechanism is based on the plasma transport in the evening equatorial ionosphere resulting from the sunset electrodynamical processes

   83:  Thermospheric meridional winds are calculated in this paper for the low-latitude station, Cachoeira Paulista, in Brazil using ionospheric F layer peak height h(max) as the primary database for different seasons and solar activity conditions. A servo model is used that expresses the ionospheric F layer peak height displacements as a function of chemical loss, diffusion, thermospheric meridional wind and vertical plasma drift. The method used is similar to, and an extension of, the one used in recent years for midlatitudes, where the effect of vertical plasma drift is considered negligible. We have included in our analysis the effect of vertical plasma drift on h(max) over Cachoeira Paulista by using a vertical drift model which is a field line extension of an equatorial electric field model developed for our longitude, for which the radar data from Jicamarca, Peru, are complemented, in the sunset sector, by vertical drift from ionosonde data over Fortaleza. A numerical model on the electrodynamic coupling of the E and F regions is used to obtain the equatorial height dependence of the vertical drift needed for its field line mapping to low latitude. Meridional winds were calculated using the servo equations in which the vertical plasma drifts, and h(max) values deduced from Cachoeira Paulista ionograms, were the main inputs. The magnetic meridional winds calculated for the summer equinoctial and winter months of high and low solar activity epochs are compared with the HWM-90 and with the measurements by Fabri-Perot technique available for Cachoeira Paulista. The results show varying agreements. The paper presents details of the method of analysis and the comparison of the results.

   83:  We examine the appearance of the ozone hole over a populated area with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The largest population concentrations on the South American continent nearest the ozone hole region are Punta Arenas, Chile (53.0 degrees S, 70.9 degrees W) and Ushuaia, Argentina (54.5 degrees S, 68.0 degrees W), located close to the strait of Magallanes, opposite the Antarctic Peninsula. A special field mission was held in Punta Arenas, in September-October 1995 to investigate the vertical distribution of ozone during the appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole. Previous work has shown that the city of Punta Arenas is located at the edge of the hole area and is affected every year during a few days in the October period. The ozone trend near these locations is -0.5
   83:   per year using the yearly averages and -1.2
   83:   per year using the October means. This trend is 2 to 5 times larger than the global average. Several ozonesondes of the electrochemical concentration cell type were launched from Punta Arenas to determine the vertical distribution of ozone during ''normal'' and ''perturbed'' conditions. The ozone hole passed over Punta Arenas on October 12, 13 and 14, 1995. In addition to the sondes, which were launched once a day, ozone column amounts and UVB radiation were measured with a ground-based ozone Brewer spectrophotometer. The strongest ozone depletion over Punta Arenas in 1995 occurred on October 13, when the ozone column decreased from a ''normal'' value of about 325 Dobson Units (DU) to 200 DU; the vertical distribution of ozone on October 13 compared with October 6 shows depleted ozone roughly 50
   83:   less during hole conditions in the stratosphere. The UVB intensities have increased accordingly. The spectral ratio for October 13 to October 4 is 13 times larger at 297 nm

   83:  Three fundamental questions are addressed for the location of Punta Arenas (53.0 degrees S, 70.9 degrees W), Chile: Does the Antarctic ozone hole extend over the city? If so, at what height is most of the ozone depleted? And by how much does the UVB radiation increase under ozone hole conditions? It is shown that Punta Arenas is affected by the Antarctic ozone hole, even though it is a considerable distance away from the pole. In comparison with the average global trend of -0.25
   83:   per year, the downward ozone trend at Punta Arenas is -0.5
   83:   per year (twice as large as the global average) and -1.2
   83:   per year (almost 5 times larger than the global average) using the monthly October averages. To obtain these figures, an ozone climatology of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) data from 1979 to 1992 has been used. observations of the ozone hole over Punta Arenas are described during the austral spring periods of 1992, 1993, and 1994. Systematic observations with a Brewer spectrophotometer have been made in order to measure the vertical column of ozone and the simultaneous variations in UVB radiation. In addition, the vertical distribution of ozone has been investigated during ozone hole conditions, by using ozone ECC (Electrochemical Concentration Cell) sondes launched on balloons, in order to determine at which height the ozone is reduced most. Using the 220 DU (Dobson Units) threshold as reference, we identified the ozone hole over Punta Arenas on five occasions during the 3 year period of these observations, September 1993, October 1992, 1994; and November 1993 and 1994. The vertical distribution of ozone during ozone hole conditions shows maximum ozone destruction efficiency near 15-17 km, where ozone nearly vanishes completely, on several occasions. The largest amount of ozone depletion, however, occurs above this height, just under and at the main ozone peak, where it may reach about 50
   83:  . The UVB radiation in small spectral bands may increase dramatically during ozone hole events; at 295-297 nm the observed factors of increase for Punta Arenas were between 10 and 38. The maximum integrated/weighted intensities in October, during hole events increased over background values between 2 and 3 times, which represent values near the local summer maximum but not yet beyond levels normally observed at low-latitude stations

   83:  Using the Dst index, more than 1200 geomagnetic storms, from weak to intense, spanning over three solar cycles have been examined statistically. Interplanetary Magnetic field(IMF) and solar wind data have also been used in the study. It is found that for more than 50 
   83:   of intense magnetic storms, the main phase undergoes a two-step growth in the ring current. That is, before the ring current has decayed significantly to the prestorm level, a new major particle injection occurs, leading to a further development of the ring current, and making Dst decrease a second time. Thus intense magnetic storms may often be the result of two closely spaced moderate storms. The corresponding signature in the interplanetary medium is the arrival of double-structured southward IMF at the magnetosphere

   83:  In order to clarify the wave characteristics of Pi2 and Pc 4-5 magnetic pulsations around the dip equator, we analyzed magnetic data from the latitudinally dense magnetometer array in Brazil. We found that the phase difference between Pi2 pulsations observed at globally separated low-latitude stations is small, whereas Pi2 pulsations observed within the dayside dip equator region of +/-2 degrees latitude show phase lags of about 30 degrees similar to 50 degrees behind those in the off-dip equator region. Pc 4-5 magnetic pulsations at the dip equator also show the same phase character. Pi2 amplitudes are enhanced in the equatorial region, where the phase lags of pulsations must be associated with the enhancement of ionospheric conductivity. The equatorial phase lags can be explained by invoking the induction effect of the equatorial enhanced ionospheric current above the good conductor Earth

   83:  This paper attempts to summarize the current understanding of the storm/substorm relationship by clearing up a considerable amount of controversy and by addressing the question of how solar wind energy is deposited into and is dissipated in the constituent elements that are critical to magnetospheric and ionospheric processes during magnetic storms. (1) Four mechanisms are identified and discussed as the primary causes of enhanced electric fields in the interplanetary medium responsible for geomagnetic storms. It is pointed out that in reality, these four mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, but interdependent, interact differently from event to event. Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are found to be the primary phenomena responsible for the main phase of geomagnetic storms. The other two mechanisms, i.e., HILDCAA (high-intensity, long-duration continuous auroral electrojet activity) and the so-called Russell-McPherron effect, work to make the ICME and CIR phenomena more geoeffective. The solar cycle dependence of the various sources in creating magnetic storms has yet to be quantitatively understood. (2) A serious controversy exists as to whether the successive occurrence of intense substorms plays a direct role in the energization of ring current particles or whether the enhanced electric field associated with southward IMF enhances the effect of substorm expansions. While most of the Dst variance during magnetic storms can be solely reproduced by changes in the large-scale electric field in the solar wind and the residuals are uncorrelated with substorms, recent satellite observations of the ring current constituents during the main phase of magnetic storms show the importance of ionospheric ions. This implies that ionospheric ions, which are associated with the frequent occurrence of intense substorms, are accelerated upward along magnetic field lines, contributing to the energy density of the storm-time ring current. An apparently new controversy regarding the relative importance of the two processes is thus created. It is important to identify the role of substorm occurrence in the large-scale enhancement of magnetospheric convection driven by solar wind electric fields. (3) Numerical schemes for predicting geomagnetic activity indices on the basis of solar/solar wind/interplanetary magnetic field parameters continue to be upgraded, ensuring reliable techniques for forecasting magnetic storms under real-time conditions. There is a need to evaluate the prediction capability of geomagnetic indices on the basis of physical processes that occur during storm time substorms. (4) It is crucial to differentiate between storms and nonstorm time substorms in terms of energy transfer/conversion processes, i.e., mechanical energy from the solar wind, electromagnetic energy in the magnetotail, and again, mechanical energy of particles in the plasma sheet, ring current, and aurora. To help answer the question of the role of substorms in energizing ring current particles, it is crucial to find efficient magnetospheric processes that heat ions up to some minimal energies so that they can have an effect on the strength of the storm time ring current. (5) The question of whether the Dst index is an accurate and effective measure of the storm time ring current is also controversial. In particular, it is demonstrated that the dipolarization effect associated with substorm expansion acts
to reduce the Dst magnitude, even though the ring current may still be growing

   83:  At Fortaleza, Brazil, in the equatorial zone about 400 km south of the magnetic equator a presunrise (secondary) maximum of spread F occurrence is observed during sunspot minimum and, in particular, during December solstice, The spread F takes the form of patches of irregularities that are convecting eastwards at similar to 50 m s-1. Most of the patches are collocated with bottomside bulges of the ionosphere. Our measurements indicate that these bottomside bulges are unstable due to a gradient-drift instability that is slowly growing and produces the spread F. The bulges themselves seem to be evidence of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability process

   83:  The 12-month moving averages of total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) total ozone data for 14 years (1979-1992) were examined for quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and quasi-triennial oscillation (QTO) and compared with stratospheric low-latitude zonal wind and equatorial eastern Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). The equatorial ozone had a strong QBO with a period of similar to 30 months, and its maxima tallied with westerly wind maxima. At other latitudes the ozone maxima spacings were often different from 30 months, more so in the northern hemisphere. A spectral analysis showed that both hemispheres had one peak at similar to 20 months and another peak at similar to 30 months, only up to similar to 50 degrees latitude. At higher latitudes these peaks shifted to similar to 23 and similar to 36 months. For 0 degrees-50 degrees the similar to 30-month periodicity in the northern hemisphere showed abrupt phase changes, while he southern latitudes showed a roughly gradual phase shift. The northern hemisphere had an additional periodicity at similar to 4 years, roughly matching the SST. Analysis of the same data without 12-month averaging showed the above characteristics more clearly and revealed additional peaks at similar to 0.7 years (8-9 months) and similar to 1.30 years (16-17 months). All of these peaks showed shifts (mostly increases) at higher latitudes

   83:  The Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument measures carbon monoxide (CO) in the middle troposphere from a space platform. In anticipation of the deployment of MAPS aboard the space shuttle. Endeavor for two 10-day missions in 1994, plans were made to prepare a set of correlative measurements which would be used as part of the mission validation program. Eleven laboratories participated in the correlative measurement program by providing NASA with the results of their CO field programs during April and October 1994. Measurements of CO in the boundary layer, while not used in the MAPS validation, provide a picture of CO in the lower troposphere. Because measurements of CO made by different laboratories have been known to differ significantly, all correlative team members participated in an intercomparison of their measurements to define potential differences in techniques and calibration scales. While good agreement was found between some laboratories, there were differences between others. The use of similar analytical techniques and calibration scales did not always provide similar results. The results of the intercomparisons were used to normalize all ground-based measurements to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adiministration/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory CO reference scale. These data provide an internally consistent picture of CO in the lower atmosphere during spring and fall 1994

   83:  Methane (CH4) concentrations have been measured in the lower atmosphere in Brazil on board a Brazilian research aircraft. Air samples were obtained at different heights by grab sampling, and taken for analysis by flame ionization detector (FID) gas chromatography at INPE (the Brazilian Institute for Space Research). The sampling region is the cerrado area of central Brazil, around the cities of Brasilia, Cuiaba, Alta Floresta, and Porto Nacional. Instead of concentrating on plume characteristics, an effort was made to describe the average mixed atmosphere, keeping a distance from direct burning sources. The measurements of atmospheric CH4 during the dry season have shown larger mixing ratios compared to the wet season. This finding has consistently been observed for different dry seasons, but especially for the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation: Brazil (SCAR-B) field mission. For comparison, measurements near the ground in a region not directly affected by biomass burning (Natal, Brazil) show concentrations that are 39 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) less than the biomass burning results, which is 4 times the size of the seasonal amplitude at oceanic stations within about 10 degrees of the equator, thus making the biomass burning values comparable to those observed at northern hemisphere midlatitudes. The vertical distribution for these regions seems to be well mixed, showing differences of about 40 ppbv between the different sampling areas of the SCAR-B experiment. The CH4 mixing ratio was in general well correlated with the CO mixing ratio

   83:  Neste artigo mostra-se que a atividade espacial, com intensidade crescente nos £ltimos anos, vem se tornando um campo de aá∆o de agentes n∆o apenas tÇcnicos e cient°ficos, como tambÇm econìmicos e pol°ticos. Diversamente da bipolaridade da era da Guerra Fria, o atual quadro caracteriza-se pela variedade n∆o apenas de naá‰es mas tambÇm de grupos empresariais part°cipes em empreendimentos multinacionais. Neste quadro cada vez mais complexo e dinÉmico, a necessidade do pensamento estratÇgico Ç patente, ainda mais ao se ponderar a relevÉncia das atividades espaciais para o Pa°s. Ser† a partir de uma compreens∆o ampla do contexto internacional das atividade espaciais que dever∆o ser elaboradas as linhas mestras que guiar∆o as iniciativas nacionais. AtravÇs de aá‰es coordenadas pela AEB, disp‰e-se atualmente de uma Pol°tica Nacional de Desenvolvimento das Atividades Espaciais e do Programa Nacional de Atividades Espaciais. Como resultado de decis‰es estratÇgicas do passado, no que tange ao setor espacial o Brasil ocupa hoje um papel de destaque no cen†rio mundial. Apesar de dificuldades oráament†rias crìnicas, situa-se entre os £nicos 15 pa°ses do mundo a terem desenvolvido com sucesso um satÇlite, disp‰e de um dos 14 centros de lanáamento de satÇlites operacionais em todo o mundo, e ser† em breve provavelmente o nono pa°s a dispor de seu pr¢prio ve°culo lanáador de satÇlites. Em funá∆o destas posiá‰es j† conquistadas, intensificam-se constantemente as manifestaá‰es de interesse e as oportunidades de novos projetos em parceria internacional, entre as quais certamente destaca-se aquela de tornar-se o £nico pa°s em desenvolvimento a participar da Estaá∆o Espacial Internacional. ABSTRACT This article argues that in recent years space activities are increasingly involving not only scientific and technological agents but also economic and political ones. Differently from the bipolarity of the Cold War era, the present stage is characterized by the variety not only of nations, but also of entrepreneurial groups taking part in multinational endeavors. In this increasingly complex and dynamic scene, the need for strategical rationale becomes clear, even more when the relevance of space activities for Brazil is taken into account. The main guidelines for the national initiatives in the area must be based on a deep understanding of the international context of space activities. Presently, the Brazilian space activities are guided by the National Policy for the Development of Space Activities and the National Program of Space Activities, with actions coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB). As a result of strategical decisions made in the past, Brazil occupies today a relevant role in the space segment world scenario. Although having to face continuous budgetary constraints, it is among the only 15 countries in the world that successfully developed a satellite, it has one of the 14 operational satellite's launch centers in the world, and it will soon become the ninth country to have its own satellite launching vehicle.As a consequence of the position it has attained in the international space scene, Brazil has been facing a growing number of offers and opportunities to take part of projects in cooperation with foreign partners. Among those, the opportunity to become the only developing country to participate of the International Space Station program should be highlighted

   83:  O Brasil, pa°s de dimens‰es continentais com uma grande populaá∆o, diversidade de atividades econìmicas e com a maior †rea florestal preservada do Planeta, engajou se, dadas essas condiá‰es, em atividades espaciais, desde o in°cio das mesmas, dotandose de instrumentos e de recursos materiais e humanos, com competància para participar do esforáo mundial de utilizaá∆o e exploraá∆o do espaáo. Embora apresentando grande desenvolvimento em algumas regi‰es e †reas de atividades, apresenta v†rias e grandes disparidades regionais, as quais motivaram-no a adotar as aplicaá‰es da tecnologia espacial, para tentar resolver toda a sorte de problemas, como aqueles mencionados acima. O Brasil possui, por exemplo, seus pr¢prios satÇlites de comunicaá‰es (cinco), voltados para um sistema de comunicaá‰es razoavelmente desenvolvido, envolvendo v°deo, dados e telefonia; em contraposiá∆o h† v†rios locais no Pa°s, que n∆o s∆o servidos por qualquer tipo de telecomunicaá‰es. Ainda, devido Ös suas j† mencionadas dimens‰es continentais e oceanos adjacentes, agravados por uma pobre rede terrestre de sondagem da atmosfera, tem que contar com os satÇlites meteorol¢gicos para a previs∆o do tempo e estudos clim†ticos. Com relaá∆o aos satÇlites de sensoriamento remoto, os mesmos s∆o a £nica maneira de cobrir †rea t∆o enorme, com tantos problemas ambientais e de recursos naturais, a serem monitorados e administrados. O presente artigo apresenta, de uma maneira sucinta, os principais benef°cios diretos das principais aplicaá‰es brasileiras da tecnologia espacial, nas †reas da meteorologia, telecomunicaá‰es e sensoriamento remoto. S∆o tambÇm apresentados os benef°cios indiretos, proporcionados pela ind£stria aeroespacial, principalmente de sua componente espacial. ABSTRACT Brazil is a country of continental dimensions, with a large population, a great diversity of economic activities and the largest forest in the planet and due to these reasons has been engaged in space activities since their very beginning, adopting instruments and human and material resources to participate of the world effort on the use and exploitation of space. Although reasonably well developed in some regions and activity areas, presents several large regional desparities that motivated it towards the application of space technology to address all kinds of problems. For example, the country has its own telecommunication satellites (five of them) supporting a reasonably developed 74 Edson Baptista Teracine communication system involving video, data and telephony; in counterpart there are several sites in the country that are not served by any type of telecommunication. Due to its already mentioned dimensions and neighboring oceans, together with the poor terrestrial sounding network, the country has to count on satellites for weather forecasting and climate studies. With respect to remote sensing satellites they are the only way of covering such an enormous area with so many environmental and natural resources aspects to be monitored and managed. This paper mentions briefly the direct benefits of Brazilian main applications of space technology namely meteorology, telecommunications and remote sensing. Are also mentioned the indirect benefits provided by the aerospace industry mainly the space branch of it

   83:  A pesquisa cient°fica do ambiente espacial pr¢ximo ao nosso planeta vem sendo realizada por cerca de tràs dÇcadas. Grande parte dessa pesquisa vem sendo feita por cientistas da †rea de ciàncias espaciais e atmosfÇricas (CEA) do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). Considerando as dimens‰es continentais do Brasil, o corpo da †rea de ciàncias espaciais e atmosfÇricas do INPE Ç relativamente pequeno e isso demonstra a necessidade de se criar outros centros de pesquisas espaciais no pa°s. Baseados em tal necessidade, cientistas da CEA tomaram a iniciativa de incentivar o desenvolvimento de novos n£cleos de pesquisas espaciais junto a algumas universidades e instituiá‰es de pesquisa nacionais. O sucesso de tal esforáo, entretanto, n∆o depende s¢ dos cientistas mas tambÇm do governo, por se tratar de uma ciància b†sica. Esse artigo focaliza a importÉncia da ciància espacial tanto para a geraá∆o do conhecimento cient°fico como para ajudar a melhor assessorar a sociedade. Por ciància espacial subentende-se aqui a ciància das diferentes regi‰es atmosfÇricas, incluindo a ionosfera, (excluindo, porÇm, a meteorologia), a magnetosfera, o espaáo interplanet†rio, as relaá‰es Sol-Terra e o espaáo c¢smico gal†tico e extra-gal†tico. Este artigo trata do desenvolvimento de cargas £teis para bal‰es, foguetes e satÇlites, porÇm n∆o aborda a construá∆o de ve°culos lanáadores. A importÉncia da ciància espacial foi aqui apresentada atravÇs de exemplos de experiàncias passadas da necessidade do conhecimento cient°fico aqui concernente, alÇm da necessidade de preparar o pa°s para um futuro pr¢ximo, no novo sÇculo, que certamente exigir† um maior dinamismo na geraá∆o do conhecimento cient°fico deste ramo emergente da ciància. ABSTRACT Scientific research on our planet's space environment has been conducted in Brazil for the last three decades. Most of this research has been accomplished by scientific groups of the Space and Atmospheric Science Area of the National Institute for Space Reserarch (INPE). Considering the continental dimension of Brazil, the size of INPE's space and atmospheric science group is very modest indeed, which highlights the need to have a broader base of science community spread over the country. INPE's scientists have taken important initiatives, especially during the last ten years , to encourage and establish space science education and training programs in Brazilian universities and research institutions. However, the success of such efforts do not depend entirely on INPE's scientists. Since space science is basically seen as a fundamental science, not withstanding its multisided and eventual benefits to the society, political willpower on the part of the government is important to guaranty success in such efforts. This article focus on the importance of space science education and research to improve our understanding of the diverse problems of space environment in Brazil, and for the eventual use of such knowledge in many space activity based solution to human/societal problems. By space sciences it is understood here the sciences of earth's atmosphere including the ionosphere (but not including meteorological domain), the magnetosphere, the interplanetary space, solar-terrestrial relationship, and the galactic and extra-galactic space. This article covers also programs and developments of scientific payloads for balloons, rockets and satellites, but does not cover technology aspects of rocket and satellite platforms. The importance of space science studies in Brazil is highlighted through practical examples, from our experience, of the need of information, stemming from such studies, to private firms, national and international scientific communities. Examples will be cited of problems arising from the space environmental characteristics unique to Brazilian territory such as the ionospheric plasma bubble phenomenon that cause strong interference on space based telecommunication systems. Besides the practical need to know about the influence of space phenomena in our day to day life it is pointed out that the study of space sciences is important also for a better understanding of the different processes that control our space environment. Other points of importance to the study of space sciences addressed here include some suggestions to improve the development of this branch of science in Brazil. Because space phenomena do not posses international frontiers the field of space science investigations constitute natural subject of common interest to many countries. This situation can stimulate international collaboration projects and political/diplomatic approximation among countries. Since the early years of space research present Brazilian space environment has offered challenging opportunities for numerous experimental campaigns initiated by many foreign countries, notably, USA, Germany and Japan, with the active participation and collaboration of Brazilian scientists

   83:  We present the results of the spectral classification of the 82 brightest galaxies in a sample of 17 compact groups. We verify that the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are preferentially located in the most early-type and luminous galaxies of the groups, as is usually observed in the field. But these AGNs also appear to be systematically concentrated toward the central parts of the groups. Our observations suggest correlation between activity types, morphologies, and densities of galaxies in the compact groups. This is consistent with a scenario in which galaxies of compact: groups evolve by interacting with their environment and are currently in a quiet phase of their activity.

Two types of Alfven intermittent turbulence are identified: Pomeau-Manneville intermittency and crisis-induced intermittency. The significance of this theory for Alfvenic intermittent turbulence observed in the solar wind is discussed

   83:  A recent compilation of globular cluster data [Harris, private communication (1991)] has been examined for the purpose of selecting a sufficiently large set of globular clusters with reliable distance estimates. The absolute differences between recent and past estimates of the cluster parameters V(HB) and E(B - V) have been studied in statistically representative (but not mutually exclusive) subsets; resulting in a conservative estimate of the average distance modulus error of 0.40m for a total selected sample of 134 objects. The effects of spatial and metallicity segregation on the statistics of this sample are investigated. The adopted distance scale uses consistent correction terms for metallicity and reddening according to the precepts in Racine  Harris [AJ, 98, 1609 (1989)]. From a direct comparison with the spatial configuration of clusters derived in the past, random observational errors are shown to dominate the uncertainties in locating
the clusters along their lines of sight

   83:  Based on the spectroscopic survey of de Carvalho et al., we analyze the structural and dynamical properties of 17 Hickson compact groups. This analysis probes a region of 0.degrees 5 x 0.degrees 5 around each group and shows that most of them are part of larger structures. Our results also suggest that the Hickson sample is composed of different dynamical stages of the groups" evolution. Specifically, we identify three possible evolutionary phases among groups in the sample: loose groups, core + halo systems, and compact groups, each one presenting a distinct surface density profile. This sequence is consistent with the replenishment scenario for the formation and evolution of compact groups within larger and less dense systems

These observations will provide accurate astrometric positions of major interest for dynamical studies of the motion of the Galilean satellites. The aim of this work is to give observational data directly usable for theoretical studies. We made 166 observations of 64 mutual events from 28 sites. The corresponding data are given in the present paper and compared with the theoretical predictions. The accuracy of each observation has been determined. For each observation, information is given about the telescope, the receptor, the site and the observational conditions

A total of 745 hours of observation at 408 MHz were completed from an Equatorial site in Colombia. The observations cover the celestial band O-h < alpha < 24(h), and -24 degrees 22' < delta < +35 degrees 37'. Preliminary results of this partial survey will be discussed. A review of the instrumental setup and a similar to 10 degrees resolution sky map at 408 MHz is presented

   83:  It is shown that the assumption that sodium can be used as a passive tracer for studying atmospheric waves in the region above 90 km is not always valid. An analysis of wave structures observed in the sodium layer by lidar shows that the associated oscillations in the mixing ratio of sodium are frequently too large to be produced by vertical displacements in the presence of mixing ratio gradients. On some occasions these large amplitude oscillations appear to be associated with the formation of sporadic sodium layers, and it is suggested that both phenomena are most probably related to the windshear concentration of sodium ions

   83:  We report on the first realtime ionospheric predictions network and its capabilities to ingest a global database and forecast F-layer characteristics and "in situ" electron densities along the track of an orbiting spacecraft. A global network of ionosonde stations reported around-the-clock observations of F-region heights and densities, and an on-line library of models provided forecasting capabilities. Each model was tested against the incoming data; relative accuracies were intercompared to determine the best overall fit to the prevailing conditions; and the best-fit model was used to predict ionospheric conditions on an orbit-to-orbit basis for the 12-hour period following a twice-daily model test and validation procedure. It was found that the best-fit model often provided averaged (i.e., climatologically-based) accuracies better than 5

There was a sharp contrast however, in model-measurement comparisons involving predictions of actual, unaveraged, along-track densities at the 295 km orbital altitude of TSS-1R In this case, extrema in the first-principle models varied by as much as an order of magnitude in density predictions, and the best-fit models were found to disagree with the "in situ" observations of Ne by as much as 140

The discrepancies are interpreted as a manifestation of difficulties in accurately and self-consistently modeling the external controls of solar and magnetospheric inputs and the spatial and temporal variabilities in electric fields, thermospheric winds, plasmaspheric fluxes, and chemistry

   83:  For the sets of magnetic clouds studied in this work we have shown the existence of a relationship between their peak magnetic field strength and peak velocity values, with a clear tendency that clouds which move at higher speeds also possess higher core magnetic field strengths. This result suggests a possible intrinsic property of magnetic clouds and also implies a geophysical consequence. The relatively low field strengths at low velocities is presumably the cause of the lack of intense storms during low speed ejecta. There is also an indication that this type of behavior is peculiar for magnetic clouds, whereas other types of non cloud-driver gas events do not seem to show a similar relationship, at least for the data studied in this paper. We suggest that a field/speed relationship for magnetic clouds, as that obtained in our present study, could be associated with the cloud release and acceleration mechanism at the sun. Since for magnetic clouds the total field tyically has a substantial southward component, Bs, our results imply that the interplanetary dawn-dusk electric field, given by v x Bs (where v is the cloud's velocity), is enhanced by both factors. Therefore, the consequent magnetospheric energization (that, is governed by this electric field) becomes more efficient for the occurrence of magnetic storms

Quasi-periodic fluctuations in dusk-time (1730-1900 LT) F layer vertical plasma drift (eastward electric field) occurred over Kodaikanal coherent with DP 2 type magnetic fluctuations (period approximate to 25 min) at the day-side dip equator and auroral/subauroral latitudes. This first-ever observation at the dusk-side equator is in agreement with the two-cell equivalent current system previously proposed for DP 2 fluctuations. The results strongly suggest that the magnetospheric electric field responsible for DP 2 fluctuations penetrates to equatorial ionosphere on the dusk-side as on the day-side. An additional observation is that the electric field fluctuation amplitude increases towards the nightside suggesting the influence of duck sector electrodynamics in the observed signature of the DP 2 electric field

   83:  The size of a sunspot cycle is important for a variety of physical effects on the Earth or in its vicinity. A wide variety of rnethods are used for its predictions. In a recent communication [Kane, 1997], these rnethods were mentioned. Amongst these, the "precurso" methods [Ohl, 1966; Brown and Williams, 19691 are considered to be the most successful. The minimum values of the 12-monthly moving averages of the geomagnetic aa index in the beginnings of the various Solar Cycles are very well-correlated (correlation + 0.91, using 11 data points for Solar Cycles 12-22) with the 12-monthly moving averages R(max) 12 of the maximum sunspot number of the various cycIes. For Solar Cycle 23, Kane [1997] gave a prediction for R(max) as 170 Ò 13. However, this estimate had an error. lt should have been 170 Ò 3 1, where (Ò 3 1) represents a Ò la estimate

For the first lime we report evidence of large fluctuations in irregularity zonal drift velocities (similar to 50-180 m/s) associated with magnetospheric disturbances. The fluctuations in the zonal velocity, anti correlated with those in vertical velocity, are unlikely to be produced by prompt penetration of disturbance meridional electric field of high latitude/magnetospheric origin. A mechanism is proposed to explain the velocity fluctuations that involves: (1) Hall polarization vertical electric field in the E-layer that is field line mapped on to F- layer, and (2) electric field caused by vertical current arising from divergence in field line integrated zonal Pedersen current; both produced by the primary disturbance zonal electric field. Enhanced nighttime E region conductivity with possible spatial gradients, a requirement for the functioning of this mechanism, is observed to be present from other simultaneous measurements, whose source is suggested to be particle induced ionization in the south Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA) zone, as known also from previous studies

   83:  The INPE sodium lidar was recently modified so as to enable measurements to be made of the Doppler temperature of the Na atoms in the:atmospheric sodium layer. Measurements have been made-on a total of 15 nights from July to October, 1998, providing temperature-profiles between heights of about 83 and 105 km. Almost:all measurements showed a mesopause temperature structure strongly perturbed by oscillations which appear to be caused by gravity waves and/or tides, with peaks in sodium density occurring at almost the same height as the temperature maxima on the bottom side of the sodium layer. The lowest temperatures, between 170 and 200 K, typically occur above 100 km, and the average profile for all our measurements is similar to the winter profile seen at midlatitudes, with a mesopause temperature of 190 K at 103 km

The best relationship for droughts was with unambiguous ENSOW (El Nino year with SO and W near the middle of the calendar year) and for floods with C (cold SST). The droughts were generally widespread, although Assam and Bengal might have had normal rainfall or even floods when other subdivisions had droughts. In some ENSOW years when all India rainfall was normal, the rainfall in subdivisions was either normal or mixed (droughts in some subdivisions, floods in others). However, droughts and floods occurred during other types of events also, and ENSOW or C were neither sufficient nor necessary. Some floods and droughts were associated with incorrect type (floods during El Nino, etc.), and some occurred during non-events, indicating that factors unrelated to EN, or SO, or W, or C may be more influential in some years

   83:  Stratospheric ozone at middle latitudes shows a seasonal variation of about +/- 20
   83:  , a quasi-biennial oscillation of 1-10
   83:   range and a long-term variation in which the level was almost steady up to about 1979 and declined thereafter to the present day by about 10
   83:  . These variations are expected to be reflected in solar UVB observed at the ground, but in an opposite direction. Thus UVB should have had a long-term increase of about 10-20
   83:  ,, which should cause an increase in skin cancer incidence of about 20-40
   83:  . Skin cancer incidence has increased all over the world, e.g. about 90
   83:   in USA during 1974-1990. It is popularly believed that this increase in skin cancer incidence is related to the recent ozone depletion. This seems to be incorrect, for two reasons. Firstly, the observed skin cancer increase is too large (90
   83:  ) compared with the expected value (40
   83:  ) from ozone depletion. Secondly, cancer does not develop immediately after exposure to solar UVB. The sunburns may occur within hours; but cancer development and detection may take years, even decades. Hence the observed skin cancer increase since 1974 (no data available for earlier periods) must have occurred due to exposure to solar UVB in the 1950s and 1960s, when there was no ozone depletion. Thus, the skin cancer increase must be attributed to harmful solar UVB levels existing even in the 1960s, accentuated later not by ozone depletion (which started only much later, by 1979) but by other causes, such as a longer human life span, better screening, increasing tendencies of sunbathing at beaches, etc., in affluent societies. On the other hand, the recent ozone depletion and the associated UVB increases will certainly take their toll; only that the effects will not be noticed now but years or decades from now. The concern for the future expressed in the Montreal Protocol for reducing ozone depletion by controlling CFC production is certainly justified, especially because increased UVB is harmful to animal and plant life also. However, because the increased cancer incidence observed so far may not be (entirely) due to ozone depletion, other causes need to be investigated urgently and, if possible, remedied. Otherwise, deaths due to skin cancer will continue even after CFC production is controlled and ozone levels are recovered. There is no room for complacency. If nothing else is possible, use of protective screens and creams and avoiding exposure to sunlight during peak hours (10:00-15:00 h) should be strongly recommended

   83:  Each year during 1881-1990 was examined to check whether it had an El Ni§o (EN) and/or a Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) minimum (SO) and/or warm (W) or cold (C) equatorial eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures SST. Several years were ENSOW, which were further subdivided into two groups namely, unambiguous ENSOW where El Ni§o existed and SOI minima and SST maxima were in the middle of the calendar year (May-August), and ambiguous ENSO W where El Ni§o existed but the SOI minima and SST maxima were in the early or late part of the calendar year, not in the middle. Other El Ni§o events were of the type ENSO, ENW, ENC and EN. Some years not having El Ni§o were of the types SOW, SOC, SO, W and C, the last one (C) containing all anti-El Ni§os, i.e. La Ni§as. Remaining years were termed as non-events. For all these years, the normalized rainfall deviations from the mean were examined for seven rainfall series, three in India and four in Sri Lanka, For the all India summer monsoon rainfall and Indian southern peninsula summer monsoon rainfall, unambiguous ENSOW years showed a very good association with droughts. The Sri Lanka southwest monsoon rains also showed a similar tendency; but the Sri Lanka second intermonsoon season rainfall showed a strong opposite tendency (floods instead of droughts). For other types of El Ni§o years, results were generally obscure. For C type events, results were opposite to those of unambiguous events, as expected. It is suggested that for obtaining composite maps based on El Ni§o years, only the unambiguous ENSOW years may be used

The rocket attained an altitude of 524 km. The electron temperature was determined through the derivative of the current versus voltage characteristics of the Langmuir probe and the detection of the floating potential. Results are compared with the IRI model, and the divergence of the results with the model is discussed

In this paper we present and discuss the distribution statistics of ESF events, mainly from ionograms, using the long term data sets available from Equatorial and low latitude stations in Brazil and Argentina. Significant longitudinal dependence in the ESF occurrence is observed. The results are discussed on the basis of the longitude dependent magnetic declination angle that characterizes this region and on relevant thermospheric parameters

   83:  We report strong evidence for a 304 day periodicity in the spin history of the accretion-powered pulsar GX 1 +4 that is most probably associated with the orbital period of the system. We have used data from the Burst and Transient Source Experiment on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory to show a clear periodic modulation of the pulsar frequency from 1991 to date, in excellent agreement with the ephemeris proposed by Cutler, Dennis,  Dolan in 1986. Our results indicate that the orbital period of GX 1+4 is 303.8 Ò 1.1 days, making it the widest known low-mass X-ray binary system by more than I1 order of magnitude and putting this long-standing question to rest. A likely scenario for this system is an elliptical orbit in which the neutron star decreases its spin-down rate (or even exhibits a momentary spin-up behavior) at periastron passages due to the higher torque exerted by the accretion disk onto the magnetosphere of the neutron star. These results are not inconsistent with either the X-ray pulsed flux light curve measured by BATSE during the same epoch or the X-ray flux history from the All-Sky Monitor on board the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer

   83:  An overview of the Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE A) field mission is presented. TRACE A was conducted to provide a comprehensive investigation of the chemical composition, transport, and chemistry of the atmosphere over the tropical South Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent South American and African continents. Measurements for TRACE A consisted of a remote sensing component to derive tropospheric ozone and biomass burning patterns, an airborne atmospheric chemistry component to determine the composition of the air in the most pristine areas of our research domain as well as to characterize the photochemistry and transport of trace gas emissions from both fire and biogenic sources, a series of ozonesonde observations, and an enhanced radiosonde network and airborne meteorological measurements that provided information about the transport of trace gases and the physical processes that were responsible for their observed distributions. The data were interpreted through the use of both photochemical and meteorological numerical models. The picture that emerges from TRACE A is that widespread biomass burning in both South America and southern Africa is the dominant source of the precursor gases necessary for the formation of the huge amounts of ozone over the South Atlantic Ocean. In addition, however, the meteorology in this region of the world is favorable for the accumulation of these pollutants over the tropical Atlantic basin so that photochemical processes produce large quantities of ozone in situ. The generation of ozone occurs over scales of thousands of kilometers and is unusually enhanced in the upper troposphere where relatively high concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) prevail. This latter finding suggests that convective processes (or other lifting mechanisms) may play an important role in the generation of tropospheric ozone or that there may be an additional significant upper tropospheric source of NOx, such as from lightning

   83:  Tropospheric trace gases were measured from an aircraft platform. The flights were organized to sample air masses from the geographic area of central Brazil, where the vegetation, a savanna-type environment with the local name of ''cerrado'', is subject to burning every year, especially through August, September, and October. These measurements were made as a Brazilian local contribution to the international field campaign organized by NASA, the Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE A) mission, and the Southern African Fire Atmospheric Research Initiative (SAFARI). The major NASA TRACE A mission used the NASA DC 8 aircraft, with most flights over the South Atlantic Ocean region. In Brazil, missions using small aircraft measured ozone and carbon dioxide continuously, and carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and methane using grab sampling. In addition, ground-based measurements were made continuously over most of the dry months of 1992, and ozonesondes were launched at three different sites. Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite-East (GOES E) images and a special network of radio soundings provided meteorological information, and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) images indicated the distribution of fire pixels in the region of interest. Most of the biomass burning in 1992 occurred in the state of Tocantins, with about 22
   83:   of all the burning in Brazil. The state of Mate Grosso was second, with 19
   83:   of all burning. The Brazilian aircraft was used mostly in these two states, near the cities of Porto Nacional and Cuiaba, for in situ sampling; 31 vertical profiles were made in air masses considered to be well mixed, that is, not in fresh plumes. Although the major interest was the dry season, sampling was also made during the previous wet season period in April 1992 for comparison; 10 vertical profiles were obtained using the same aircraft and measurement techniques. There is a clear difference between these two opposite seasonal periods, most evident in the O-3 and CO data. Both Cuiaba and Porto Nacional show some 30-60 parts. per billion by volume (ppbv) larger methane concentrations, for example, during the dry season, in comparison to the wet season, the difference at Cuiaba being larger. The methane data for the wet season show no significant differences between Cuiaba and Porto Nacional mixing ratios, which seems to exclude the existence of significant sources or sinks at these sites during this wet season. The ozone mixing ratios vary around 15 +/- 5 ppbv in the wet season, and from a minimum of 35 to a maximum of 70 +/- 10 ppbv, depending on height, in the dry season. The largest variability is seen in the carbon monoxide mixing ratios which vary from 90-100 ppbv in the wet season to maxima of 300 at 3.3 km and 600 ppbv at 1.2 km height in the dry season

   83:  A series of large mesoscale convective systems that occurred during the Brazilian phase of GTE/TRACE A (Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic) provided an opportunity to observe deep convective transport of trace gases from biomass burning. This paper reports a detailed analysis uf flight 6, on September 27, 1992, which sampled cloud- and biomass-burning-perturbed regions north of Brasilia. High-frequency sampling of cloud outflow at 9-12 km from the NASA DC-8 showed enhancement of CO mixing ratios typically a factor of 3 above background (200-300 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) versus 90 ppbv) and significant increases in NO, and hydrocarbons, Clear signals of lightning-generated NO were detected; we estimate that at least 40
   83:  of NOx at the 9.5-km level and 32
   83:   at 11.3 km originated from lightning, Four types of model studies have been performed to analyze the dynamical and photochemical characteristics of the series of convective events. (1) Regional simulations for the period have been performed with the NCAR/Penn State mesoscale model (MM5), including tracer transport of carbon monoxide, initialized with observations. Middle-upper tropospheric enhancements of a factor of 3 above background are reproduced. (2) A cloud-resolving model (the Goddard cumulus ensemble (GCE) model) has been run for one representative convective cell during the September 26-27 episode. (3) Photochemical calculations (the Goddard tropospheric chemical model), initialized with trace gas observations (e.g., CO, NOx, hydrocarbons, O-3) observed in cloud outflow, show appreciable O-3 formation postconvection, initially up to 7-8 ppbv O-3/d. (4) Forward trajectories from cloud outflow levels (postconvective conditions) put the ozone-producing air masses in eastern Brazil and the tropical Atlantic within 2-4 days and over the Atlantic, Africa, and the Indian Ocean in 6-8 days, Indeed, 3-4 days after the convective episode (September 30, 1992), upper tropospheric levels in the Natal ozone sounding show an average increase of similar to 30 ppbv (3 Dobson units (DU) integrated) compared to the September 28 sounding. Our simulated net O-3 production rates in cloud outflow are a factor of 3 or more greater than those in air undisturbed by the storms, Integrated over the 8- to 16-km cloud outflow layer, the postconvection net O-3 production (similar to 5-6 DU over 8 days) accounts for similar to 25
   83:   of the excess O-3 (15-25 DU) over the South Atlantic. Comparison of TRACE A Brazilian ozonesondes and the frequency of deep convection with climatology [Kirchhoff et al., this issue] suggests that the late September 1992 conditions represented an unusually active period for both convection and upper tropospheric ozone formation

   83:  The Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE A) experiment, sponsored by the NASA GTE program, was a multinational field mission that took place simultaneously in Brazil, Africa, and the South Atlantic region, between the African and the Brazilian coasts. The general objective of the field mission was to investigate the tropospheric minor constituent composition, known to be disturbed by biomass burning practices. This report describes ozone measurements that were made by the Brazilian component. Two field missions in central Brazil were made with the objective of investigating ozone concentrations in the biomass burning source region: one smaller mission in the wet season period, April, and a major mission in the dry season, September/October 1992. The main field expedition during the dry season obtained data over a period of about 20 days in September and a few days in October 1992, in a savanna environment of central Brazil. Simultaneous surface ozone and ozone soundings were made. In the wet season the observation site was Goiania (16 degrees S, 49 degrees W); and in the dry season, two other sites were added: Cuiaba (16 degrees S, 56 degrees W) and Porto Nacional (11 degrees S, 48 degrees W). In addition, measurements were also made at an Atlantic coast site, Natal (6 degrees S, 35 degrees W), outside of the savanna region, and not affected directly by the biomass burning source areas, used as a control site. The average behavior of the ozone concentrations at the different sites suggests that surface ozone concentrations tend to be rather uniform, despite different precipitation rates, but slightly larger at the drier sites. However, other factors, such as burning fuel, for example, or cloudiness, may be also important to determine ozone concentrations. This is reflected by large day-to-day variabilities that are common in the source region. The diurnal variation of the surface ozone concentrations maximize around 1600 LT. Hourly averages in September, at this time, amount to 47 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) at Porto Nacional and 40 ppbv at Cuiaba. For this station the values are lower than those of previous years (55 ppbv in 1991 and 48 ppbv in 1990). Only small differences, of the order of 5 ppbv, are observed between the source (burning) sites and Natal (the control site) in the wet season. In April, only 16 ppbv are observed at Natal. Much larger concentrations may be observed occasionally in the source areas, in the dry season. For example, at Porto Nacional, 80 ppbv have been measured at the surface and in the lower troposphere. In comparison with the coastal site, near the surface, large scatter in concentration values at Porto Nacional (20-80 ppbv) contrast with the smaller concentration range seen at Natal (20-40 ppbv). In addition, at Natal the ozone mixing ratios below about 600 hPa are distributed around a vertical gradient in which the mixing ratios increase with height, whereas at Porto Nacional in the same height region, larger concentrations and a large scatter of the data are apparent. In the upper troposphere, perhaps surprisingly, the ozone concentrations at Natal and Porto Nacional are about equal, 70 ppbv at 10 km (with larger scatter at Natal than at Porto Nacional), probably reflecting a net production of ozone along the pathways from the source regions, coupled with its longer lifetime at the higher altitudes. This data set is consistent with the hypothesis that tropical ozone in the troposphere is produced photochemically from biomass burning products in the dry season. These products are exported from the source regions to the upper atmospheric levels by dry and wet convection and once in the upper atmospheric levels are taken eastward to the South Atlantic by the prevailing winds, where they contribute to local ozone formation. The air masses at Natal, Brazil, in the lower atmospheric levels, i.e., below about 500 hPa, originate from the South Atlantic. This allows one to classify Natal air masses as pristine over most of the year and justifies the stations use as a control station. However, the data now presented, combined with the detailed analyses of the other TRACE A studies, allows on to conclude that in the dry season, Natal ozone concentrations below about 500 hPa are perturbed by combustion products consistent with long-range transport from Africa

   83:  Tropospheric ozone data measured by ozonesondes during the Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE A) field mission and the multiyear pre-TRACE A program are analyzed jointly with tropospheric ozone amounts derived from remote satellite data (''residuals''), We present here the first detailed analysis of the entire Ascension Island pre-TRACE A data set, Data from the three pre-TRACE A ozonesonde sites are used to establish a coherent spatial and temporal climatology of ozone in the southern tropical Atlantic region. This analysis shows a significant ozone seasonality over the Atlantic region, with a period of maximum values that extends from the austral winter through at least October at Natal, Brazil, and Ascension Island. Concentrations begin to decline somewhat earlier at Brazzaville, Congo, especially at lower altitudes. Although Natal exhibits a significantly lower annual average than Ascension Island or Brazzaville by about 4 Dobson Units (DU), the magnitude of the seasonal amplitude at Natal is the largest of the three stations. Additionally, more of the seasonal amplitude at Natal is due to a contribution from ozone in the middle and upper troposphere than at either Ascension Island or Brazzaville Amplitudes as large as 15 DU are measured at individual sites, and the residuals show an average amplitude over the southern tropical Atlantic region of 10-12 DU. Statistical comparison of the residuals to the ozonesonde climatology show that while the residuals tend to underpredict both the means and the seasonal amplitudes compared to the in situ data, they provide a good representation of the variance of ozone in this region and predict the local annual and seasonal means to within better than 10
   83:   and seasonal amplitudes to within 15

   83:  The seasonal tropospheric ozone maximum in the tropical South Atlantic, first recognized from satellite observations [Fishman et al., 1986, 1991], Save rise to the IGAC/ STARE/SAFARI 1992/TRACE A campaigns (International Global Atmospheric Chemistry/South Tropical Atlantic Regional Experiment/Southern African Fire Atmospheric Research Initiative/Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator-Atlantic) in September and October 1992. Along with a new TOMS-based method for deriving tropospheric column ozone, we used the TRACE A/SAFARI 1992 data set to put together a regional picture of the O-3 distribution during this period, Sondes and aircraft profiling showed a troposphere with layers of high O-3 (greater than or equal to 90 ppbv) all the way to the tropopause. These features extend in a band from 0 degrees to 25 degrees S, over the SE Indian Ocean, Africa, the Atlantic, and eastern South America. A combination of trajectory and photochemical modeling (the Goddard (GSFC) isentropic trajectory and tropospheric point model, respectively) shows a strong connection between regions of high ozone and concentrated biomass burning, the latter identified using satellite-derived fire counts [Justice et al., this issue]. Back trajectories from a high-O-3 tropical Atlantic region (column ozone at Ascension averaged 50 Dobson units (DU)) and forward trajectories from fire-rich and convectively active areas show that the Atlantic and southern Africa are supplied with O-3 and O-3-forming trace gases by midlevel easterlies and/or recirculating air from Africa, with lesser contributions from South American burning and urban pollution. Limited sampling in the mixed layer over Namibia shows possible biogenic sources of NO, High-level westerlies from Brazil (following deep convective transport of ozone precursors to the upper troposphere) dominate the upper tropospheric O-3 budget over Natal, Ascension, and Okaukuejo (Namibia), although most enhanced O-3 (75 
   83:   or more) equatorward of 10 degrees S was from Africa. Deep convection may be responsible for the timing of the seasonal tropospheric O-3 maximum: Natal and Ascension show a 1- to 2-month lag relative to the period of maximum burning [cf. Baldy et al., this issue; Olson ct al., this issue]. Photochemical model calculations constrained with TRACE A and SAFARI airborne observations of O-3 and O-3 precursors (NOx, CO, hydrocarbons) show robust ozone formation (up to 15 ppbv O-3/d or several DU/d) in a widespread, persistent, and well-mixed layer to 4 km. Slower but still positive net O-3 formation took place throughout the tropical upper troposphere [cf. Pickering et al., this issue (a); Jacob et al., this issue]. Thus whether it is faster rates of O-3 formation in source regions with higher turnover rates or slower O-3 production in long-lived stable layers ubiquitous in the TRACE A region, 10-30 DU tropospheric O-3 above a similar to 25-DU background can be accounted for. In summary, the O-3 maximum studied in October 1992 was caused by a coincidence of abundant O-3 precursors from biomass fires, a long residence time of stable air parcels over the eastern Atlantic and southern Africa, and deep convective transport of biomass burning products, with additional NO from lightning and occasionally biogenic sources

   83:  Three fundamental questions are addressed for the location of Punta Arenas (53.0 degrees S, 70.9 degrees W), Chile: Does the Antarctic ozone hole extend over the city? If so, at what height is most of the ozone depleted? And by how much does the UVB radiation increase under ozone hole conditions? It is shown that Punta Arenas is affected by the Antarctic ozone hole, even though it is a considerable distance away from the pole. In comparison with the average global trend of -0.25
   83:   per year, the downward ozone trend at Punta Arenas is -0.5
   83:   per year (twice as large as the global average) and -1.2
   83:   per year (almost 5 times larger than the global average) using the monthly October averages. To obtain these figures, an ozone climatology of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) data from 1979 to 1992 has been used. Observations of the ozone hole over Punta Arenas are described during the austral spring periods of 1992, 1993, and 1994. Systematic observations with a Brewer spectrophotometer have been made in order to measure the vertical column of ozone and the simultaneous variations in UVB radiation. In addition, the vertical distribution of ozone has been investigated during ozone hole conditions, by using ozone ECC (Electrochemical Concentration Cell) sondes launched on balloons, in order to determine at which height the ozone is reduced most. Using the 220 DU (Dobson Units) threshold as reference, we identified the ozone hole over Punta Arenas on five occasions during the 3 year period of these observations, September 1993, October 1992, 1994; and November 1993 and 1994. The vertical distribution of ozone during ozone hole conditions shows maximum ozone destruction efficiency near 15-17 km, where ozone nearly vanishes completely, on several occasions. The largest amount of ozone epletion, however, occurs above this height, just under and at the main ozone peak, where it may reach about 50 
   83:  . The UVB radiation in small spectral bands may increase dramatically during ozone hole events; at 295-297 nm the observed factors of increase for Punta Arenas were between 10 and 38. The maximum integrated/weighted intensities in October, during hole events increased over background values between 2 and 3 times, which represent values near the local summer maximum but not yet beyond levels normally observed at low-latitude stations.

   83:  Balloon-borne X ray measurements with high time resolution were carried out in the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly to investigate the fine structure of the precipitation in this region. Measurements were obtained on two balloon flights launched from Cachoeira Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil, on January 26 and February 1, 1994, and were supported by onboard electric field and geomagnetic field ground data. In one flight, we have found that rapid changes do occur in times of about 0.05 s during periods of a few seconds. They should be considered as the first evidence of the presence of microbursts in the low L value region of the South Atlantic anomaly. These microbursts were not correlated with sferic signatures in the same hemisphere and may be correlated with magnetic fluctuations in the geomagnetic field. Energy-time features of the microbursts are examined in order to identify possible responsible mechanisms

The profile is used to derive the vertical distribution of ozone between 60 and 86 km. The ozone profile shows a minimum I concentration at 77 km and a secondary maximum of 1.34 x 10(8) cm(-3) at 82 km. The height of the secondary maximum is lower than observed at midlatitudes, and the 77-km minimum is sharper than that which has been observed at low latitudes by satellite measurements

   83:  A study of sporadic sodium (Ns) layers observed at Sao Jose dos Campos (23 degrees S, 46 degrees W) shows that during their occurrence the form of the background sodium layer is different from that which it normally takes when Ns layers are absent. During Ns events, peak sodium in the background layer typically occurs below 90 km, whereas the peak of the average layer observed at our location is around 93 km. The observed change could be caused either by a loss of sodium on the topside of the layer or by a displacement of sodium to lower heights. The consistency of these two mechanisms with our observations, and with the known properties of Ns layers, is examined, but we are unable to determine which of the mechanisms is responsible for the observed

   83:  Satellite and ground-based observations from March 28 to 29, 1992, were combined in the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure to derive realistic global distributions of the auroral precipitation and ionospheric convection which were used as inputs to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermosphere-ionosphere general circulation model (TIGCM). Comparisons of neutral model winds were made with Fabry-Perot measurements and meridional winds derived front ionosondes. The peak equatorward winds occurred 1-2 hours later in the model. Gravity waves launched from high-latitude Joule heating sources reached the equator in about 2 hours and agreed with observed variations in the height of the maximum electron density (hmF2) and in the meridional winds. Joule heating events produced minima in the O/N-2 ratio that moved equatorward and usually westward in longitudinal strips which lasted about a day. Changes in the O/N-2 ratio and in the peak electron density (NmF2) were strongly correlated so the observed daytime NmF2 values for stations near 50 degrees magnetic latitude were generally reproduced by MIE-TIGCM on  the second day of the simulation, The AMIE-TIGCM underestimated the electron density after midnight by up to a factor of 2 in midlatitudes, while the modeled F2 layer was about 35 km lower than the observations at midnight. Shifting the model winds 2 hours earlier at night could double the NmF2 at 0400 LT and increase hmF2 by 20 km. NmF2 could also be increasedat night by realistically increasing the TIGCM nighttime downward fluxes of O+ at the upper boundary

   83:  We present the first joint comparison of global measurements of F region characteristics with three models used widely in the specification of the ionospheric-thermospheric system. The models, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), the field line interhemispheric plasma (FLIP) model, and the Thermospheric-Ionospheric General Circulation Model (TIGCM), represent a unique set of capabilities with major differences in approaches to the prevailing physics and different levels of computational complexity. The database was developed by a global network of 53 ionosonde stations operating around-the-clock for the period March 22 through April 4, 1992 in collaboration with the ATLAS 1 mission. The emphasis is on the F region characteristics of peak heights (h(m)F(2)) and densities (NmF2), their climatological (i.e., average) behavior during the ATLAS 1 period, and associated cause-effect relationships. We explore latitudinal and local time variations with attention to the influences of meridional winds and Plasmaspheric fluxes in the maintenance of different domains in the ionospheric-thermospheric system. We find that all three models tend to underestimate the values of h(m)F(2) and NmF2 with the largest discrepancies in NmF2 resulting in the FLIP and TIGCM representations at night. These discrepancies can grow to levels as large as 110
   83:   near 0400 LT, a ''rediscovery'' of the old but unsettled issue of maintenance of the nighttime ionosphere. This nighttime discrepancy is traceable in first order to model underestimates of prevailing meridional winds. The contributions of plasmaspheric fluxes are also considered, with the conclusion that they are of secondary importance, but substantially more work is necessary to uniquely quantify their role. In contrast to their nighttime characteristics, the FLIP and TIGCM generally have excellent agreement (i.e., 6 +/- 6
   83:  ) with daytime observations of NmF2, and the IRI tends to underestimate the observed values of NmF2 by a nominally LT-insensitive level of 28 +/- 6
   83:  . Other campaign results are reviewed in this issue, with a focus on regional responses to the prevailing conditions and their characterization in terms of latitudinal distributions off region heights and densities

   83:  The study of energy transfer between the different regions of the solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere system is a fundamental issue in Solar-Terrestrial Physics. In this work we have studied the degradation of the solar wind energy budget through the solar wind - magnetosphere coupling down to the ring current injection and the auroral ionospheric dissipation during the main phase of magnetic superstorms (Dst < -240 nT). The interplanetary magnetic field, density, temperature, and solar wind velocity measurements collected by the ISEE 3 satellite, and the total energy flux of high-latitude precipitating particles collected by the NOAA 6 satellite were used for this study. The solar wind energy budget was determined from the kinetic energy flux of the particles in the interplanetary medium. The energy transfer from the solar wind into the magnetosphere was estimated through a dayside magnetopause ram pressure corrected  version of the Perraultand Akasofu epsilon function. The energy injection into the ring current was estimated under the DPS theorem restriction and introducing the decay parameter tau in the evolution equation as a continuous function of the Dst index. The energy dissipation estimate in the auroral ionosphere via Joule heating in one hemisphere was computed using ionospheric and interplanetary data through a new method. Previous statistical and case studies for substorms have shown that the total energy dissipated as Joule heating is roughly twice that of the ring current injection. Our results show that the energy dissipation via Joule heating in the auroral ionosphere is about half of the ring current energy injection during superstorms

   83:  Equatorial ionospheric responses to magnetospheric storm/substorm-associated electric fields are investigated for a few intense events of the equinoctial months of solar maximum years 1978-1979. All the magnetic storms considered here are the result of the transit at Earth of interplanetary magnetic clouds. The interplanetary magnetic field data B-z from the ISEE 3 satellite, the auroral electrojet activity index AE, and the ring current index Dst are used as indicators of the disturbed magnetospheric conditions, and the ionospheric response features are analyzed using the F layer critical parameters h'F, h'F-3, h(p)F(2), and f(o)F(2). Focus is given to identify, when a large number of sequential substorms occurs, (1) the responses to prompt penetration electric field (from individual substorm events) as different from the delayed effect from the disturbance dynamo electric field and (2) the verification of local time dependences of the disturbance electric field polarity as predicted from the existing theoretical models. We have found evidence of near-midnight polarity reversal of prompt penetration disturbance electric field during the course of a developing substorm. Evidence is provided also on the near-midnight polarity reversal for the disturbance dynamo electric field. The prereversal enhancement electric field at sunset, produced by the F layer dynamo, is found to undergo drastic day-to-day variations in the course of a disturbed interval. However, the competing influences of the prompt versus delayed electric fields after a series of substorms could result at times in partial, or even complete, cancellation of the effects, so that the prereversal enhancement in the vertical drift could appear unaffected by the disturbances. There  are indications that the disturbance dynamo electric field effects on the equatorial ionosphere last for one more day past the end of the substorm recovery

   83:  A study of the thermal structure of the low-latitude (30 degrees N to 30 degrees S) ionosphere under equinoctial conditions at low, medium, and high solar activity has been carried out using the Sheffield University plasmasphere-ionosphere model (SUPIM) and Hinotori satellite observations. The study reveals the existence of an anomaly in the plasma (electron and ion) temperature in the topside ionosphere during the evening-midnight period. The anomaly, called the equatorial plasma temperature anomaly (EPTA), is characterized by a trough around the magnetic equator with crests on either side. The trough develops before the crests. The model results show that the anomaly occurs between 1900 and 0100 LT at altitudes between 450 and 1250 km; the strongest anomaly occurs around 2130 LT at 950 km altitude during high solar activity. The temperature trough of the anomaly arises from the adiabatic expansion of the plasma and an increase in plasma density caused by the prereversal strengthening of the upward vertical E x B drift. The temperature crests arise from the combined effect of the reverse plasma fountain and nighttime plasma cooling. The electron temperature measured by the Hinotori satellite near 600 km altitude during medium and high solar activity periods shows the existence of the EPTA with characteristics in close agreement with those obtained by the model. The model also reproduces the occurrence of a daytime temperature bulge in the electron temperature in the bottomside ionosphere; the ion temperature shows no bulge

   83:  A physical mechanism and the location and latitudinal extent of an additional layer, called the F-3 layer, that exists in the equatorial ionosphere are presented. A statistical analysis of the occurrence of the layer recorded at the equatorial station Fortaleza (4 degrees S, 38 degrees W; dip 9 degrees S) in Brazil is also presented. The F-3 layer forms during the morning-noon period in that; equatorial region where the combined effect of the upward ExB drift and neutral wind provides a vertically upward plasma drift velocity at altitudes near and above the F-2 peak. This velocity causes the F-2 peak to drift upward and form the F-3 layer while the normal Fa layer develops at lower altitudes through the usual photochemical and dynamical effects of the equatorial region. The peak electron density of the F-3 layer can exceed that of the F-2 layer. The F-3 layer is predicted to be distinct on the summer side of the geomagnetic equator during periods of low solar activity and to become less distinct as the solar activity increases. Ionograms recorded at Fortaleza in 1995 show the existence of an F-3 layer on 49
   83:   of the days, with the occurrence being most frequent (75
   83:  ) and distinct in summer, as expected. During summer the layer occurs earlier and lasts longer compared to the other seasons; on the average, the layer occurs at around 0930 LT and lasts for about 3 hours. The altitude of the layer is also high in summer, with the mean peak virtual height being about 570 km. However, the critical frequency of the layer (f(o)F(3)) exceeds that of the F-2 layer (f(o)F(2)) by the largest amounts in winter and equinox; f(o)F(3) exceeds f(o)F(2) by a yearly average of about 1.3 MHz

   83:  We analytically investigate the use of a wire mesh ground screen (fence) and a halo of extension panels around a helically fed parabolic reflector in order to estimate the ground contribution to the antenna noise temperature in an experiment aimed at surveying the sky at decimeter wavelengths. We use geometric diffraction theory to model the effect of these screening and blocking shields when scanning in azimuth at tilt angles from zenith in the range 0 degrees greater than or equal to Z greater than or equal to 45 degrees. We report estimates based on existing formulas for monofilar axial-mode helical antennas with expected low-level sidelobes in the direction of the halo region. As long as there is no significant coupling between the near-field patterns of both the feed and the diffracting halo, estimates using the Fraunhofer approximation agree with those calculated with the Fresnel approach at a tilt angle Z(eq), which increases with the proximity of the diffracting edge from the near-/far-field boundary of the feed pattern. Our estimates show that for a fence of some IO-dB attenuation and high enough to level out the horizon profile at the prime focus of the antenna, the diffracted components dominate the contribution for tilt angles Z less than or similar to 35 degrees The fence is the main diffractor when Z greater than or similar to 20 degrees, but for Z greater than or similar to 25 degrees its contribution becomes insensitive to the presence of the halo. On the other hand, if the attenuation is low (<1dB), the increase in ground solid angle with tilt angle makes the contribution due to transmission and ground exposure the dominant one

   83:  We have studied Cen A (NGC 5128) in the X-ray band (3-20 keV) and soft gamma-ray band (40-600 keV) with the Large Area Counter (LAG) of the Ginga sattellite (1989 March and 1990 February) and with a balloon-borne low background detector (Welcome-1, 1991 November), respectively. The observed continuous spectra show a power-law shape (r similar to 1.8) with relatively heavy absorption (N-H similar to 1.5 x 10(23)H cm(-2)) at the low-energy end and a possible break at similar to 180 keV. We analyzed the total spectra as the sum of the direct power-law flux from the central engine, the Compton-scattered flux from a cold cloud near to the engine, and the iron fluorescence-line flux. By assuming that the geometry around the central engine remained unchanged during the two-year period, we studied two possible cold cloud geometries by comparing Monte-Carlo simulations with our observations: the first is the Compton-reflection model in which the cloud forms a slab covering 2 pi sr behind the central engine, the second is a case where the central source is totally surrounded by a cold cloud. We found that the latter geometry reproduces our data well; the observed power-law spectrum is then identified as direct flux from the central engine which undergoes a break at similar to 180 keV

   83:  Magnetovariational fields recorded by an array of magnetometers in the equatorial region of north-northeast Brazil are analyzed to infer the configuration of internal induced currents in and around the extensive intracratonic Parnaiba basin. Only nighttime magnetovariational fields were used because of the prevailing uniform source field conditions. For periods exceeding 40 min. the vertical fields at all inland sites are dominated by the effects of electric currents originating in the northeast, in the deep Atlantic Ocean. Below this period, although best developed in the 12-15 min. period range, the anomalous signatures are principally controlled by two distinct continental current paths. The first is associated with a N60 degrees E trending graben-like structure in the southeastern part of the basin (named the Parnaiba Basin Conductivity Anomaly-PBCA) and the second appears as a subsurface sedimentary channel, from the NW corner of the array to the central part of the basin. This is named the LINK anomaly, as it connects the northwestern Marajo basin with the Parnaiba basin. While the PBCA is shown to highlight the importance of basement tectonics in the geological evolution of the Parnaiba basin, the LINK anomaly provides strong geophysical evidence of the direction of the sea intrusion into the region of the basin and possibly indicates the connectivity of the Parnaiba basin to the adjoining Amazon basin through the Marajo basin. Frequency and polarization dependence suggest that the induction response of individual structures is not determined by the local conductivity alone but also by their interconnectivity as well as by their linkage to the continental shelf and deep oceanic region

For stratosphere and tropopause, the temperature variations near the equator and North Pole somewhat resembled the 50 mb low latitude zonal winds, mainly due to prominent QBO. For troposphere and surface, the temperature variations, especially those near the equator, resemble those of eastern equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperatures, mainly due to prominent QTO. In general, the temperature trends in the last 35 years show stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming. But the trends are not monotonic. For example, the surface trends were downward during 1960-70, upward during 1970-82, downward during 1982-85 and upward thereafter. Models of green-house warming should take these non-uniformities into account

   83:  Intense geomagnetic storms with DST index less than or equal to-100 nT were recorded on 9 March and II March 1993 associated with solar activity on 6 March and 9-10 March, respectively. In this paper, we discuss the characteristic features of the solar origins of the two events that gave rise to coronal and interplanetary disturbances and as a consequence produced strong geomagnetic activity at the Earth. The source of the activity in one case is attributed to a major 3M7.0 flare that occurred on 6 March 1993 and in the other case, to two large filament disruptions on the disk during 9-10 March, 1993. Both these sources were found to be located near changing or varying low-latitude coronal holes. They were also located close to the heliospheric currents sheets. Distinct X-ray activity was observed for both the events as observed by the Yohkoh SXT telescope. The detailed evolution and a comparison of these events on the basis of Yohkoh soft X-ray observations are presented here

   83:  Close temporal correlation between high-frequency Langmuir waves and low-frequency electromagnetic whistler waves has been observed recently within magnetic holes of the solar wind. In order to account for these observations, a theory is formulated to describe the nonlinear coupling of Langmuir waves and whistler waves. It is shown that a angmuir wave can interact nonlinearly with a whistler wave to produce either right-hand or left-hand circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. Nonlinear coupling of Langmuir waves and whistler waves map lead to the formation of modulated Langmuir wave packets as well as the generation of circularly polarized radio waves at the plasma frequency in the solar wind. Numerical examples of whistler frequency, nonlinear growth rate and modulation frequency for solar wind parameters are calculated

   83:   of all the bursts are reverse slope, 38
   83:   normal and 5
   83:   bi-directional. Also, we obtained the following results: (a) the best fits for the average half power duration and for the average drift rate as a function of frequency are given by t1/2=1.7x10(4)f-0.60 and /df/dt/=(0.09 +/- 0.03)f((1.35 +/- 0.10)), respectively; (b) the frequency range of most of the type III bursts is less than 250 MHz; (c) the number of bursts decreases with increasing starting frequency and flux; (d) peak flux decreases with increasing frequency. The relations obtained fit well for higher frequency observations. Assuming an improved density model and type III emission at 2(nd) harmonic, the beam parameters of type III bursts are determined

   83:  A simple method MEM-MRA, where spectral peaks are located by MEM (Maximum Entropy Method) and about a dozen most prominent ones are used in MRA (Multiple Regression Analysis) to estimate their amplitudes and phases, was applied to the sunspot number (Rz) series of 1748-1996. Spectral characteristics were different in the successive 3 intervals of 83 years each. Hence, for predictions, only data for the recent 83 years were considered relevant. From the spectra for 1914-1996, the most significant peaks at 5.3, 8.3, 10.5, 12.2, 47 years were used for reconstruction. The match between observed and reconstructed values was good (correlation +0.90). When extrapolated, the reconstructed values indicate a sunspot number maximum for the present solar cycle 23 as 140 +/- 9, to occur in year 2000 and for the next solar cycle 24 as 105 +/- 9, to occur in year 2010-2011

   83:  Resistivity data from 105 audiomagnetotelluric soundings (AMT) are used to construct eleven interpreted geoelectric sections from Floriano to Jaic¢s cities, in southeast Piaui State. Based on preliminary analysis of layered earth model inversion, the depth and thickness of resistive and conductive layers arc defined and tentatively related to lithological sedimentary units and the basement. Notwithstanding inherent limitations, gently dipping layers, sinclines and anticlines, are followed within depths of 500 and sometimes even 1000 meters. Other geological structures, such as faults, horst and grabens are also inferred from the soundings. However, steeply dipping conductive structures and lateral conductivity inhomogeneities seem to affect horizontal layer model interpretation and require further studies. Nevertheless, the profiles indicate a highly structured basin border. Consequently, the lateral shallowing of the sedimentary layer towards the present day border might be apparent. In fact, it could have been associated with a tectonism that produced foldings and faultings. Geoelectrical evidences of major vertical displacements are seen near the cities of Floriano, NazarÇ, Oeiras and Picos.

   83:  Radon measurements were performed during the 33 transit and mission flights of the GTE/ABLE-3A campaign aboard NASA Electra aircraft 429 from Virginia to Thule (Greenland), Barrow, Bethel and Cold Bay (Alaska) and over adjacent areas. Radon was measured by a real-time radon-meter based on electrostatic precipitation of Rn-daughter products and alpha-ray spectrometry. Large scale variations of tropospheric radon versus latitude were observed from the mean results of radon activity for all the flights. It appears that there is generally a good agreement between the radon activity means, considered by altitude band, and the assessed origin of the airmasses, on the basis of a low radon emission by permafrost and tundra covered continental areas in Arctic regions. From the significant lowest values of radon activities measured during the GTE/ABLE-3A, an average radon activity for Arctic air-mass was determined and found to be (56 Ò 7) mBq /m3 . Radon free air-mass were not encountered, which indicates, in most cases, at least some continental influence, from the point of view of radon presence. The study of possible correlations between radon variations and events recorded for other species has not been pursued because of the high uncertainties associated to the very low radon activities recorded by the instrument in Arctic regions. Resumo: Medidas de radìnio foram realizadas durante os 33 vìos da Miss∆o GTE/ABLE3A a bordo da aeronave Electra 429 da NASA, da Virginia (USA) atÇ Thule (GroelÉndia), Barrow, Bethel e Cold Bay (Alaska, USA) e nas regi‰es adjacentes. O radìnio foi medido por um medidor funcionando em tempo real e baseado na precipitaá∆o eletrost†tica dos produtos de decaimento do radìnio e na espectrometria alfa. Variaá‰es de grande escala do radìnio troposfÇrico em funá∆o da latitude foram observadas atravÇs da an†lise das mÇdias para todos os vìos. Observou-se geralmente uma boa concordÉncia entre as mÇdias das atividades de radìnio por faixa de altitude, e a poss°vel origem das massas de ar, considerando a baixa emiss∆o de radìnio nas regi‰es cobertas pelo permafrost e pela tundra nas regi‰es µrticas. A partir dos valores mais baixos das atividades de radìnio registradas durante esta campanha, um valor de atividade t°pica da atividade de radìnio nas massas de ar no µrtico foi determinada: (56 Ò 7) mBq/m3. Massas de ar desprovidas de radìnio n∆o foram encontradas, o que parece indicar na maior parte dos casos uma certa contribuiá∆o continental, do ponto de vista da presenáa de radìnio. A an†lise das poss°veis correlaá‰es entre as variaá‰es dos teores de radìnio e eventos registrados para outras espÇcies medidas simultaneamente durante a miss∆o n∆o foi desenvolvida devido Ös incertezas elevadas, associadas Ös atividades, de radìnio muito baixas registradas pelo instrumento nas regi‰es µrticas

   83:  O perfil de altura real da ionosfera obtido a partir de ionogramas Ç uma ferramenta muito £til para os estudos ionosf6ricos. Neste trabalho faz-se uma comparaá∆o entre os perfis deduzidos usando dois mÇtodos: POLAN e Digissonda. O POLAN Ç o mÇtodo polinomial de c†lculo de altura real que tem sido mais usado recentemente pela comunidade cient°fica, para fins de compatibilidade dos resultados. A Digissonda tambÇm calcula a altura real usando um mÇtodo polinomial. A vantagem da Digissonda Ç que a tarefa de convers∆o do ionograma em perfil de altura real Ç bem mais simples uma vez que os dados j† est∆o em forma digital e prontos para serem processados. Foi observado que, para a maioria dos casos analisados no per°odo maráo/abril de 1990, h† uma boa concordÉncia entre os perfis obtidos pelos dois mÇtodos e que, em mÇdia, os perfis da Digissonda podem ser usados para os mesmos estudos nos quais o POLAN tem sido usado. Apesar de que algumas discrepÉncias tenham sido observadas elas s∆o previs°veis (ocorrem quando a densidade eletrìnica da regi∆o F, Ö noite, est† muito acima dos valores mÇdios para per°odos magneticamente calmos), portanto n∆o invalidariarn o uso, dos perfis deduzidos pela Digissonda, perante o POLAN. No entanto, Ç necess†ria uma revis∆o dos dois mÇtodos para que a causa dessas discrepÉncias seja corrigida. Abstract: The ionospheric real height profiles from ionograms are very useful in ionospheric studies. In this work, the real height profiles deduced using two different methods, POLAN and Digisonde, are intercompared. POLAN is the polinomial method whose use has been recommended by the international scientific community. Digisonde also uses a polinomial method to calculate real height profiles. The advantage of the Digisonde over the POLAN is the facility that it offers to calculate the profiles because, in this case, the data are already in the digital form and ready to be processed. The intercomparison of the results obtained during the period March/April 1990 shows a good agreement of the real height profiles obtained using the two methods. It was also observed that during some disturbed periods the two methods strongly disagree, but this only occurs f when the night-time F region peak density is much higher than its quiet-time mean value. It is concluded that Digisonde real height profiles can be used in the same studies in which POLAN are being used, once one pays attention to the discrepancies observed during disturbed periods, at night. It is also suggested that it is necessary to make a revision in the two methods in order to correct for the problems leading to the disagreement between their results in some special cases

This allow us to use more refined computer methods to compute the transfer integrals. A comparison with the old results is performed and conclusions are drawn as to the relevance of the discrepancies

   83:  Ionospheric plasma irregularities associated with nighttime equatorial spread-F phenomena have been tile subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigations during recent years. Large scale plasma deplections, referred to as transequatorial bubbles or plumes, continue to attract considerable attention. The studies of ionosphere plasma irregularities assume great importance, because the irregularities degrade the radio wave signals passing through the region and, therefore, have considerable influence on the ionospheric/trans-ionospheric radio wave communications. The F-region nightglow emissions arising from ionospheric recombination processes can be used to remotely observe the dynamics of transequatorial ionospheric plasma bubbles and smaller scale plasma irregularities. In a collaborative project between the Center for Space Physics, Boston University, USA, and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil, an all-sky imaging system was put in operation at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7ßS, 45.0ß W, dip latitude 15.8ß S), in March 1987. This wide angle imaging technique provides an unique capability of permitting observations over regions covering several million square kilometers from a single observing station. Also, regular measurements of several nightglow emissions and ionospheric sounding are carried out at Cachoeira Paulista and Fortaleza (3.9ß S, 38.4ß W, dip latitude 3.7ß S). A VH:IF electronic polarimeter was in operation at Cachoeira Paulista. This clustering of observational facilities in the Brazilian sector provided coincident and complementary observations of various upper atmospheric paramcte7-s. In this paper we present and discuss some features of the OI 630.0 nm emission all-sky imaging observations carried out during the period 1987-1999. The transequatorial ionospheric plasma bubbles manifest in all-sky optical imaging observations as nearly north-south aligned intensity-depleted regions. The observed seasonal variation of the airglow depletions shows a maximum during the summer months and virtually no airglow depletions during tile winter months. The case studies presented show different forms of generation and development phases of airglow depletions during the course of a night. The all-sky images also permitted the determination of tile altitude-latitude extent of the plasma depleted regions and some results are presented. It has been observed that the altitudes reached by the plasma depleted flux tubes over the magnetic equator in the Brazilian sector often exceed 2500 km

   83:  Este artigo trata da obtená∆o do perfil de temperatura atmosfÇrica entre 80 e 100 km de altura, regi∆o da mesopausa. Ele Ç baseado no desenvolvimento e aprimoramento de uma    tÇcnica experimental simples que permite determinar a temperatura da atmosfera utilizando    um radar de laser e as propriedades f°sicas do s¢dio mesosfÇrico. A tÇcnica consiste em    sintonizar o radar de laser na linha D2 do s¢dio (5890 è) e substituir o espelho de sa°da do    laser por um interferìmetro Fabry-Perot com "free-spectral-range" de 0,0198 è, mesmo valor    da separaá∆o da estrutura hiperfina da linha D2 do s¢dio. Inicialmente um controlador de    temperatura permite variar a temperatura do Fabry-Perot e realizar uma varredura em comprimento de onda na estrutura hiperfina do s¢dio. Posteriormente um Fabry-Perot controlado por press∆o permite mudar o comprimento de onda do laser do m†ximo para o m°nimo da estrutura hiperfina. A temperatura do s¢dio, ou da atmosfera, uma vez que est∆o em equil°brio termodinÉmico, Ç inferida da convoluá∆o entre o perfil do laser e o perfil ressonante do s¢dio. Alguns experimentos foram realizados para verificar a validade da nova tÇcnica e para fornecer o perfil de temperatura na regi∆o da mesopausa. Aqui s∆o apresentados os perfis de temperatura do dia 28/08/95, obtido com o Fabry-Perot controlado por temperatura, e do dia 17/10/96, obtido com o Fabry-Perot controlado por press∆o

The problem of upper    atmosphere modeling is presented as well as the basic trends followed to solve the equations employed for this purpose. It is shown that according to these trends the methods can be    classified as analytical-empirical, integral transform and numerical. The essentials of these three  categories are discussed and commented upon. A brief account of their historical evolution is also included. It allows the reader to observe that, in spite of the present sophistication, the  foundations on which the  methods are grounded remain unchanged

   83:  Geomagnetic Deep Sounding (GDS) is an electromagnetic method of geophysics, which is    capable of imaging the Earth's interior in terms of electrical conductivity using natural    geomagnetic transient variations. The method is particularly suited to map geological structures marked by large lateral conductivity contrasts. An overview of the methodology is presented for    a magnetometer array study undertaken within and around the intracratonic Parna°ba Basin, north-northeas Brazil. The artical describes the sequential steps of data processing, the results of numerical modeling, and the related geological/tectonic implications of the inferred conductivity distribution. In the initial stages of data processing, an advanced robust regression technique is applied to derive transfer functions used to diagnose the lateral conductivity distribution in the study region. The presentation of the transfer functions in the form of induction arrows helps to identify regions of enhanced conductivity. Contour plots and pseudo-sections of the anomalous vertical fields, estimated from the hypothetical event analysis on transfer functions, are essential to characterize the orientation and dimensionality of the electrical conductive structures of the region. The analysis of various frequency and   polarization parameters indicates that an anomalous behavior of the magnetovariational field, with periods longer than one hour, is determined by currents induced in the seawater, and perhaps in the raised asthenosphere beneath the oceanic region. Yet, anomalous signatures observed at periods shorter than one hour are primarily controlled by concentrated currents in two inland conductive structures. They are the Parna°ba Basin Conductivity Anomaly (PBCA), that follows the trend of the Transbrasiliano Lineament in the eastern part of the Parna°ba Basin, and the LINK anomaly, that extends from the central part of the basin to the Maraj¢ Graben. A non-uniform thin sheet modeling has mapped the lateral extent and estimated the depth-integrated conductances of PBCA and LINK to be of the order of 2000 S and 1000 S,    respectively. The overall pattern of the inferred conductivity distribution helps to visualize the LINK anomaly as relics of a probable sedimentary channel connecting the Parna°ba Basin and Maraj¢ Graben, and which could have acted as a gateway for sea transgressions during early stages of the basin evolution. The combined inversion and forward modeling of the GDS  response functions provides the PBCA structural cross-section as an ensemble of a graben-like structure in the basement and a highly conducting block confined to the deeper central part of the basin, with an embedded resistive body in the middle. The existence of a broad conducting block confined to the central part of the basin is also consistent with magnetotelluric data, and the graben-like structure in the basement is corroborated by aeromagnetic data. The origin of graben-like structures in the basement could be possibly related to an extensional tectonism, whereas the resistive body is tentatively interpreted as a diabase dike or a recrystallized magmatic body intruded during a Cretaceous magmatic event. Carbon bearing sediments are suggested as an alternative to hydrated siliciclastic sediments to account for the high conductivity of the central block. A hydrothermal event associated with the Cretaceous magmatic activity may be the likely process to produce carbon through the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon-saturated Paleozoic sediments

   83:  In December 1995, a campaign was carried out to study the day-to-day variability in precursor signatures to large-scale ionospheric F-region plasma irregularities, using optical diagnostic techniques, near the magnetic equator in the Brazilian sector. Three instruments were operated simultaneously: (a) an all-sky (180 degrees field of view) imaging system for observing the OI 630 nm nightglow emission at Alcantara (2.5 degrees S, 44.4 degrees W); (b) a digisonde (256-Lowell) at Sao Luis (2.6 degrees S, 44.2 degrees W); and (c) a multi-channel tilting filter-type zenith photometer for observing the OI 630 nm and mesospheric nightglow emissions at Fortaleza (3.9 degrees S, 38.4 degrees W). During the period December 14-18, 1995 (summer in the southern hemisphere) a good sequence of the OI 630 nm imaging observations  on five consecutive nights were obtained, which are presented and discussed in this study. The observing period was geomagnetically quiet to moderate (Kp = 0+ to 5+; Dst = 18 nT to -37 nT). On four nights, out of the five observation nights, the OI 630 nm imaging pictures showed formations of transequatorial north-south aligned intensity depletions, which are the optical signatures of large-scale ionospheric F-region plasma bubbles. However, considerable day-to-day variability in the onset and development of the plasma depleted bands was observed. On one of the nights it appears that the rapid uplifting of the F-layer in the postsunset period, in conjunction with gravity wave activity at mesospheric heights, resulted in generation of very strong plasma bubble irregularities. One of the nights showed an unusual formation of north-south depleted band in the western sector of the imaging system field of view, but the structure did not show any ard movement, which is a normal characteristic of plasma bubbles. This type of irregularity structure, which probably can be observed only by wide-angle imaging system, needs more investigations for a better understanding of its behaviour

   83:  We have observed this star in the course of a photometric and spectroscopic program on southern and equatorial irregular variables (Cieslinski et al. 1997a, 1997b). The photometric observations (Table 1) were obtained with the FOTEX and FOTRAP (Jablonski et al. 1994) photometers at the 0.6-m Zeiss and 1.6-m Boller  Chivens telescopes of the CNPq/Laborat¢rio Nacional de Astrof°sica, Brazil. The spectroscopic observations were carried out in 1986 with the Boller  Chivens Spectrograph + 2D-Frutti on the 1.0-m Yale telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, Chile. The spectral coverage is 3900-6800 A, with 7 A resolution. Several spectra of BY Aps were collected and in all occasions the object showed a continuum compatible with M3-M711 spectral types

   83:  Several MT soundings carried out in different sites at the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly region in Brazil are distorted by severe incoherent noise. Apparent resistivity curves are displaced downwards showing local minima in frequencies around 0.1 Hz. On the other hand, power spectra analyses of pulsations in the Pc1-2 range observed at a ground station in the same region indicate the presence of linearly polarized Pi-bursts. These events may be related to the intensification of particle precipitation at localized low L values of the anomaly during magnetic disturbed periods with the characteristic polarization being probably associated with a local ionospheric current system driven by middle atmospheric ionization enhancement. It is speculated here that the mechanisms responsible for the Pibursts generation can introduce local spatial inhomogeneities in the external inducing field in the anomaly area generating the observed distortions in NIT curves

   83:  During the summers of 1986, 1988 and 1992, soil, sediment, lichen and moss samples were collected near the Brazilian Antarctic station, Comandante Ferraz, King George Island, South Shetland Archipelago, and also in other South Shetland Islands. The content of Cs-137 and of natural radionuclides were determined by gamma spectrometry. Highest Cs-137 levels were found in the lichen and mass samples, with mean values of (15 +/- 14) and (23 +/- 14) Bq kg(dry)(-1), respectively. Particularly in soil, the Ra-226 and Ra-228 contents were much higher for the samples from King George Island than for those from the other islands of the same archipelago. Based on its content in soil, the Cs-137 inventory for the 60-70 degrees S latitude band was estimated at 143 Bq m(2), which agrees with the literature data

We also outline some characteristics of MASCO, which is a coded-mask gamma-ray imaging telescope with an angular resolution of 14 in a 14 degrees (diameter, conical) field-of-view with a sensitivity of 3.92, 1.33 and 1.18 x 10(-5) photons cm-2 s-1 keV-1 in 0.05, 0.30 and 1 MeV respectively, for an integration time of 6 h and a residual atmosphere of 3.5 g cm-2. The Compton supressor described contains 12 modules of plastic scintillators, each one built as a trapezoidal prism (1 m of length) with a cross section with sides of 14 x 22 cm2 and 15 cm thick (271 of volume). Measurements of transmittance, luminescence, X-ray fluorescence and light output were carried out with the purpose of characterizing the detector. We present the estimates of the imaging sensitivity and the sensitivity for pulsed sources of the MASCO instrument

   83:  We examine the propagation of gravitational waves in the new field theory of gravitation recently proposed by Novello-De Lorenci-Luciane (NDL). This examination is done on a solvable case corresponding to a spherically symmetric static configuration. We show that in NDL theory the velocity of gravitational waves is lower than light velocity. We point out some consequences of this result and suggest a possible scenario for its verification. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. PACS: 04.50.+h; 04.30.Nk; 04.90.+e.

   83:  We use counts of faint galaxies in the regions of compact groups to extend the study of the luminosity function of galaxies in compact groups to absolute magnitudes as faint as MB = - 14.5 + 5 log h. We find a slope of the faint end of the luminosity function of approximately a = - 0.8, with a formal uncertainty of 0. 15. This slope is not significantly different from that found for galaxies in other environments. Our results do not support previous suggestions of a dramatic underabundance of intrinsically faint galaxies in compact groups, which were based on extrapolations from fits at brighter magnitudes. The normal faint-end slope of the luminosity function in compact groups is in agreement with previous evidence that most galaxies in compact groups have not been dramatically affected by recent merging

   83:  A magnetometer array study in the north-northeast of Brazil has revealed a roughly NEÓSW-trending conductive structure in the southeastern part of the intracratonic Parna°ba Basin. The magnetovariational response functions of this structure are numerically modelled to constrain its geometry to facilitate its geological and tectonic interpretation. The 2-D numerical model that incorporates the ocean effect and can account for the spatial and period dependence of the observed response locates the source regions of enhanced conductivity in a graben structure in the basement as well as in a block confined to the central part of the basin with an embedded resistive body. The anomalous electrical character of the sediments in the central part of the basin is consistent with the magnetotelluric data, the graben structure in the basement is corroborated by the aeromagnetic data. The formation of the graben structure is considered to be a manifestation of the extensional tectonics associated either with the Brasiliano orogeny or with the JurassicÓCretaceous magmatic events. The diabase dikes intruded in the basin in association with the JurassicÓCretaceous magmatic activity are shown to be accountable for the mapped resistive body entrapped in the conducting Paleozoic sediments. The thermal effects associated with magmatic activities
are invoked to produce enhanced conductivity by the generation of carbon through the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon-saturated sediments

   83:  Los rel†mpagos caracter°stica importante de las tormentas, causan espanto por su belleza, como tambiÇn por su poder de destrucci¢n. Ellos pueden ser definidos, de manera simplificada, como transferencia de cargas elÇctricas entre las nubes, y entre estas y el suelo. Pero el origen de esas cargas y de muchos factores involucrados en la liberaci¢n de los rayos, son poco conocidos. El tema, por lo tanto, reserva sorpresas. Estudios hechos en diversos paises, incluso en el Brasil, indican que la mayor°a de los rel†mpagos transporta carga negativa hac°a el suelo. Entretanto, analistas brasile§os descubrieron que el sudeste del pa°s, a veces, es asolado por tormentas en las cuales los rayos positivos son m†s numerosos. Tormentas como esas fueron identificadas recientemente en los Estados Unidos. Puesto que esos rayos son m†s destructivos que los de carga negativa, es importante conocer mejor las "tormentas positivas"

   83:  The mechanical quality factor of vanadium has been measured at audio frequencies at 294, 77.4 and 4.2 K. A quality factor as high as 1.2 x 10 7 was obtained in an annealed disc at 4.2 K. The vanadium resonator, however, presented an abundant oxidation layer on its surface a few years later, and part of this layer could easily loosen itself from the resonator. Therefore, when not in use, pure vanadium electromechanical transducers should be kept in vacuum or inert gas environments in order for them to work efficiently for long periods of time

   83:  On 30th June 1989 high sensitivity-spectral resolution observations of solar radio bursts were carried out in the frequency range of 18 - 23 GHz. The burst observed at 17:46 UT was different from the 60 bursts observed so far in the sense that it exhibited a  frequency fine structure superimposed on the ongoing burst in its rising phase, i.e. an   additional enhancement of the flux density of the order of 10 SFU, observed only in the 21 and 22 GHz frequency channels, lasting for about 4 s. Interaction of an emerging loop with an adjacent loop accelerated particles in that loop from which the broadband burst was emitted due to the gyrosynchrotron emission. The observed fine structure is    interpreted as due to thermal gyro-emission at 6th harmonic of the gyrofrequency       originated from a hot kernel with short lifetime located at the top of emerging loop. We   derived the hot kernel source parameters, the temperature as 8x10 7 K, the magnetic field as  1250 G and the density as  5x10 12 cm-3

A produá∆o de calor radiogànico calculada foi de 2,7 ÊWm-3. Os gradientes das concentraá‰es de K, U e Th indicados pela an†lise de superf°cies de tendància indicam alguma associaá∆o, ou com processos de resfriamento ou com sistemas de folhas delimitando o corpo. As concentraá‰es observadas para K e U apresentaram-se normais para corpos granit¢ides ( 3,7  e 4, 8 ppm,  respectivamente), enquanto o Th revelou-se bem menor que a mÇdia (2 1,0 ppm) para este tipo de rocha. N∆o foram observadas concentraá‰es anìmalas destes elementos, associadas, eventualmente, a mineralizaá‰es. ABSTRACT: U, Th and K concentrations were determined for 26 samples of the S∆o Roque granitic intrusion. Average values were, respectively, 5.6 ppm, 12.8 ppm and 4.. The calculated radiogenic heat production was 2.7 ÊWm-3. The gradients of the concentration of U, Th and K indicated by the trend surface analysis suggest some association either with the cooling processes or with the fault systems which are limiting the: body. The observed concentrations of K and U were normal for granites (3,7  e 4,8 ppm, respectively); however Th is lower than the normal average (21.0 ppm). Anomalous concentration of these elements, locally associated with mineralizations were not observed

   83:  O di¢xido de carbono (CO 2) Ç UM g†s importante nos processos de fotoss°ntese e respiraá∆o das plantas e tambÇm no balanáo clim†tico terrestre. Dos gases produzidos por atividades humanas, o CO 2 Ç o principal contribuinte para o efeito estufa, Sua principal fonte de produá∆o Ç a queima de combust°veis f¢sseis seguida pela queima de biomassa enquanto os principais sumidouros s∆o os oceanos e, em menor escala, a biomassa vegetal viva. O objetivo deste trabalho Ç apresentar os resultados das primeiras medidas sistem†ticas da concentraá∆o de g†s carbìnico atmosfÇrico, realizadas na regi∆o do cerrado do Brasil Central e, tambÇm, verificar a influància das queimadas no aumento desta concentraá∆o. Os resultados mostraram uma variaá∆o diurna da concentraá∆o de CO2 com maiores concentraá‰es durante a noite e madrugada, com o m†ximo ocorrendo entre as 24 e Ös 5 horas e menores concentraá‰es durante o dia, com o m°nimo ocorrendo entre as 12 e Ös 17 horas. Outro aspecto verificado foi o aumento da concentraá∆o durante os meses de agosto a outubro, coincidindo com a estaá∆o das secas, quando se constatou um maior n£mero de focos de queimadas e menor produtividade prim†ria. Este fato foi bastante evidente em Porto Nacional, TO, onde houve um aumento de 2O

ABSTRACT: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a gas important in plant photosyntesis and respiration processes and also in the terrestrial climate balance. Among the gases produced by human activities CO 2 contributes with more than 50
   83:   to the greenhouse effect. Its main source is fossil fue combustion followed by biomass burning, while its main sink are the oceans and in a smalle scale, the live vegetal biomass. The aim of this work is to present results of the first systematic measurements of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide performed in the cerrado of central Brazil and to verify the influence of biomass burnings on its concentration. The results showed a large diurnal variation of concentration, with maximun concentration during night and dawn hours (betwen 24:00 and 5:00 L.T), and the minimun occurring betwen 12:00 and 17:00 L.T. Another aspect that was verified was a concentration increase during august to october periods, wich coincide with the dry season, when great number of fires occur. This result was more evident in Porto Nacional (TO) where there was an increase of about 20

   83:  Neste artigo descrevemos o experimento TIMAX, o primeiro telesc¢pio imageador de raios-X totalmente concebido, constru°do e lanáado por um pa°s do HemisfÇrio Sul. A capacidade de imageamento Ç obtida atravÇs do uso de uma m†scara baseada num padr∆o URA 7 x 5. Mostra-se urna maneira de se obter uma ant°m†scara a partir da m†scara original, com o uso de padr‰es URA, sem a adiá∆o de peso extra Ö experiància e sem manipulaá‰es mecÉnicas complicadas. O experimento TIMAX tem uma resoluá∆o angular de 1ß,7 num campo de visada de 10ß x 10ß (FWHM). 0 plano de detectores sens°veis Ö posiá∆o consiste em 35 cintiladores cil°ndricos de NaI(TI), operando na faixa de 30 -100 keV, com uma †rea geomÇtrica, total de  400 em S∆o apresentadas imagens obtidas durante a calibraá∆o do instrumento, mostrando as vantagens da utilizaá∆o de uma antim†scara para a obtená∆o de imagens. Utilizando-se o ru°do de fundo medido no primeiro vìo em bal∆o estratosfÇrico, do experimento, mostra-se que a sensibilidade Ç de 1.2 x 10-4 f¢tons em cm-2 s-1 keV-1 na banda de 60-70 keV, para um tempo de integraá∆o de 8 horas para uma atmosfera residual 2 g cm-2. Esta sensibilidade permite a detecá∆o da maioria das fontes na regi∆o do Centro Gal†ctico. The TIMAX experiment, the first X-ray imaging telescope entirely conceived, built and launched by a country in the Southern Hemisphere, is described. The imaging capabiblity is provided by an extended mask based in a 7 x 5 URA pattern. A new and elegant technique for providing an "antimask" on URA coded-mask systems, without the addition of either extra, weight or complex mechanical maneuvering systems to the experiment, is introduced . The TIMAX experiment has an angular resolution of 1'.7 in a 10 x 10 FOV(FWHM). The position-sensitive detector plane consists in 35 cylindrical NaI(Tl) scintillators, operating in the 30 - 100 keV energy range, with a total area of 400 cm2. Images produced during the calibration of the instrument in the laboratory are presented, showing the advantages of the mask-antimask imaging technique. The background measured at balloon altitudes on the first flight of the experiment demonstrates that the sensitivity of the telescope is 1.2 x 10-4 protons cm-2 s-1 keV-1 60-70 keV range, for an integration time of 8 hours at a residual atmosphere of 2 g cm-2. This sensitivity allows the detection of most X-ray sources in the Galactic Center region

   83:  Determinou-se as concentraá‰es de radionucl°deos pertencentes Ös sÇries radioativas naturais, do K-40 e do Cs-137, proveniente da precipitaá∆o radioativa. Muitos parÉmetros f°sicos, qu°micos e biol¢gicos influenciam a distribuiá∆o vertical da radioatividade dentro dos solos. Estes fatores incluem a natureza e as caracter°sticas do solo; a quantidade de chuva depositada; as perturbaá‰es das camadas superficiais; e outras propriedades peculiares do solo, como teores e tipos dos minerais de argila, matÇria orgÉnica, etc. Para as medidas das concentraá‰es de radionucl°deos, utilizou-se a tÇcnica de espectrometria gama de alto desempenho. Foram coletadas 10 amostras de cada tipo de solo, atÇ 50 cm de profundidade, com amostras obtidas de 5 em 5 cm. Foram efetuadas an†lises que determinam, entre outros parÉmetros, pH, teores de argila, carbono orgÉnico e c†tions K+, Na+, Ca++ e Mg++ e acidez extrat°vel. TambÇm foram obtidos dados sobre a precipitaá∆o pluviomÇtrica local, temperatura e relevo, e relativos a latitude, longitude e altitude. Observou-se que as maiores concentraá‰es de Cs-137, em Bqm-2, encontram-se nas tràs amostras mais superficiais de cada perfil. Acima de 60

Constatou-se uma elevada correlaá∆o linear entre as concentraá‰es de Cs-137, nas amostras superficiais de solos de cada perfil, e o conte£do de carbono orgÉnico e, que atÇ os 50 cm de profundidade, os teores de Ac-228 e TI-208, para as diferentes amostras de cada perfil de solo analisado, n∆o variam substancialmente. Estes dados contribuem para mostrar o estado de relativo equil°brio radioativo nos seis perfis de solos estudados. Observa-se, assim, que estes solos n∆o sofreram eros∆o, e que o processo de lixiviaá∆o Ç pouco importante para estes elementos pertencentes Ös fam°lias radiativas naturais

Abstract:    This work proposes a new paradigm of Artificial Neural Net (RNA): The Unsupervised Morphologic Net (RMNS), characterized by unsupervised learning. This paradigm belongs to a class of translation invariant nets and it is based on of Mathematical Morphology (MM), Carpenter and Grossberg's ART, and Kohonen net models. At activation time, the template matching operator is implemented using translation invariant MM elementary operators. This operator propitiates a robust pattern detection with respect to addictive or subtractive noise, and/or for small rotations of the patterns to be recognized. In what it concerns to the training, the RMNS uses a Kohonen learning rule variation and a reset system inspired in the ART model proposed by Carpenter and Grossberg

   83:  Este trabalho descreve uma das mais severas devastaá‰es ambientais de que se tem not°cia neste sÇculo, numa regi∆o do Brasil que normalmente n∆o faz parte dos locais de grandes queimadas. O que ocorreu no Estado de Roraima em maráo de 1998, foi causado em primeiro lugar, pelo grande per°odo de intensa seca na regi∆o, resultado de um fenìmeno clim†tico que causou perturbaá‰es em todo o globo. Em segundo lugar, pela falta de cuidado dos nossos lavradores/fazendeiros que insistiram na pr†tica da queimada tradicional ap¢s a derrubada e capina de mata, apesar das proibiá‰es, sem perceber o perigo que estavam causando ao meio ambiente, nestas condiá‰es clim†ticas especiais. Um pequeno foco aqui, outro ali, e o que deveria ser uma queimada a mais na Çpoca de seca, tornou-se um incàndio de proporá‰es dram†ticas. ê esta a situaá∆o que se descreve neste livro. O trabalho comeáa com a descriá∆o de como ocorrem as queimadas no Brasil, em geral, e o impacto ao meio ambiente da atmosfera, no Cap°tulo 1. ê importante notar que Roraima n∆o faz parte das regi‰es do Brasil onde normalmente ocorre o maior n£mero de queimadas, que Ç a do Brasil Central, regi∆o de cerrado, no norte de Mato Grosso, em Rondìnia, Goi†s, Tocantins, e sul do Par†. 0 incàndio de Roraima foi uma grande surpresa e uma grande exceá∆o. No Cap°tulo 2 mostra-se como Ç a regi∆o geogr†fica de Roraima, que singularmente se situa em grande parte no HemisfÇrio Norte, e o Cap°tulo 3 descreve a Meteorologia da regi∆o, com informaá‰es tambÇm sobre o fenìmeno clim†tico El Ni§o. 0 Cap°tulo 4 relata como transcorreu o evento em seu momento mais cr°tico. Como iniciou e como se desenvolveu no màs de maráo. Os preju°zos materiais causados pelo incàndio s∆o descritos no Cap°tulo 5, bem como a avaliaá∆o tÇcnica sobre o tamanho da †rea queimada, e em seguida, no Cap°tulo 6, fala-se nos her¢is e vil‰es do epis¢dio. Aqueles que trabalharam duro para apagar o incàndio e tambÇm aqueles que no desempenho de suas funá‰es talvez n∆o o fizeram t∆o bem como deveriam. O fim do grande incàndio Ç narrado no Cap°tulo 7. 0 fogo Ç apagado n∆o,, pelos bombeiros, que apesar de terem trabalhado muito bem, foram impotentes diante da dimens∆o da tragÇdia, mas pelas chuvas naturais e providenciais que ca°ram no final de maráo e in°cio de abril. Summary: This book describes one of the most severe environmental destructions cited in the news in this century, in a region of Brazil which normally is not part of the large seasonal wildfires. What happened in the State of Roraima in March 1998, was caused primarily by the intense dryness of the region, consequence of a climatic phenomenon that caused unwanted perturbations all over the Globe. In addition, farmers and land owners were not careful enough, and insisted in making the traditional burnings after the clearing of forests, in spite of the Federal Government prohibitions, not realizing the danger that was imposed to the environment under the special climatic situation. A small fire here, another one over there, and what should have been just another "small" wildfire during the dry season, became a dramatic nightmare of enormous proportions. It is this situation that is described in this book.
The work starts with a description of how most of the wildfires get started in Brazil, in general, and its impact on the environment of the atmosphere, in Chapter 1. It is important to realize that Roraima is located outside of the normal Brazilian biomass burning area, which is the region in the center of the Country, a region of savannas locally called cerrados, including the north of the state of Mato Grosso, Rondonia, Goias, Tocantins and south of Para. The wildfire of Roraima was a big surprise and a great exception. The geographic region of Roraima is described in Chapter 2, calling attention to the fact that it is almost entirely situated in the Northern Hemisphere. Chapter 3 describes the meteorology of the region, including information on the climatic phenomenon El Ni§o. Chapter 4 describes the evolution of the fire event during its most critical phase. How it started and developed during the month of March. The physical damage caused by the wildfire is described in Chapter 5, as well as the technical assessment of the size of the burnt area, and in Chapter 6 the heroes and villains of the episode are mentioned. The end of the huge fire is described in Chapter 7. The fire is extinguished not by the firemen, who despite their excellent performance were impotent in view of the colossal dimensions of the tragedy, but by the natural rains that started to fall by the end of March and beginning of April

   83:  Geomagnetic Deep Sounding (GDS) is an electromagnetic method of geophysics, which is  capable of imaging the Earth's interior in terms of electrical conductivity using natural geomagnetic transient variations. The method is particularly suited to map geological structures marked by large lateral conductivity contrasts. An overview of the methodology is presented for a magnetometer array study undertaken within and around the intracratonic Parna°ba Basin, north-northeast Brazil. The article describes the sequential steps of data processing, the results of numerical modeling, and the related geological/tectonic implications of the inferred conductivity distribution. In the initial stages of data processing, an advanced robust regression technique is applied to derivet transfer functions used to diagnose the lateral conductivity distribution in the  sudy region. The presentation of the transfer functions in the form of induction arrows helps to identify regions of enhanced conductivity. Contour plots and pseudo-sections of the  anomalous vertical fields, estimated from the hypothetical event analysis on transfer functions, are essential to characterize the orientation and dimensionality of the lectrical conductive structures of the region. The analysis of various frequency and polarization  parameters indicates that an anomalous behavior of the magnetovariational field, with periods longer than one hour, is determined by currents induced in the seawater, and perhaps in the raised asthenosphere beneath the oceanic region. Yet, anomalous signatures observed at periods shorter than one hour are primarily controlled by concentrated currents in two inland conductive structures. They are the Parna°ba Basin Conductivity Anomaly (PBCA), that follows the trend of the Transbrasiliano neament in the eastern part of the Parna°ba Basin, and the LINK anomaly, that extends from the central part of the basin to the Maraj¢ Graben. A non-uniform thin sheet modeling has    mapped the lateral extent and estimated the depth-integrated conductances of PBCA and LINK to be of the order of 2000 S and 1000 S, respectively. The overall pattern of the inferred conductivity distribution helps to visualize the LINK anomaly as relics of a   probable sedimentary channel connecting the Parna°ba Basin and Maraj¢ Graben, and   which could have acted as a gateway for sea transgressions during early stages of the  basin evolution. The combined inversion and forward modeling of the GDS response functions provides the PBCA structural cross-section as an ensemble of a graben-like  structure in the basement and a highly conducting block confined to the deeper central  part of the basin, with an embedded resistive body in the middle. The existence of a broad conducting block confined to the central part of the basin is also consistent with magnetotelluric data, and the graben-like structure in the basement is corroborated by aeromagnetic data. The origin of graben-like structures in the basement could be possibly related to an extensional tectonism, whereas the resistive body is tentatively interpreted as a diabase dike or a recrystallized magmatic body intruded during a Cretaceous magmatic event. Carbon bearing sediments are suggested as an alternative to hydrated siliciclastic sediments to account for the high conductivity of the central block. A hydrothermal event associated with the Cretaceous magmatic activity may be the likely process to produce carbon through the pyrolysis of  hydrocarbon-saturated Paleozoic sediments

   83:  Data for geomagnetic activity index aa for 1868-1994 were subjected to spectral analysis for 12 intervals each of 11 consecutive years. In each interval, QBO and QTO (quasi-biennial and quasi-triennial oscillations) were observed at  2.00, 2.15, 2.40, 2.70 y and  3.20, 3.40 y, but not all in all intervals. These fluctuations are absent near (2-3 y before and after) the sunspot minima and are present only as 2 or 3 peaks in aa indices, one near or before the sunspot maximum and the other (one or two, generally the larger ones) in the declining phase of the sunspot cycle. Comparison with the solar wind (1965 onwards) showed a fairly good match, indicating that the aa variations were mostly due to similar variations in the solar wind, which must have their origin in solar physical processes. A few aa variations did not match with solar wind. When compared with terrestrial phenomena, no match was found with stratospheric low-latitude zonal wind QBO; but some QTO in aa matched QTO in ENSO (El Nino/ Southern Oscillation). This may or may not be a chance coincidence and needs further exploration

TambÇm investigamos explos‰es complexas associadas Ö fase impulsiva de "flares" observados em microondas pelo RFV e simultaneamente em raios-X duros (52-863 keV) pelo experimento HXRBS Ö bordo do satÇlite SMM. Constru°mos o espectro e a evoluá∆o temporal deste e determinamos os parÉmetros f°sicos - Ne,T e B - e o n£mero e energia totais para os elÇtrons emissores na fonte para as explos‰es simples bem como para as explos‰es complexas. Para as explos‰es simples, o °ndice espectral variou entre -1 e -4, o comportamento temporal fc i mole-duro-mole, a densidade de elÇtrons emissores na fonte  foi Ne=108 - 1010 cm-3 e o n£mero total de elÇtrons emissores na fonte foi NT=1029 - 1032. As explos‰es complexas apresentam, para cada um de seus picos constituintes, mesma faixa para o °ndice espectral, mesmo comportamento temporal deste e faixa de densidade dos elÇtrons emissores semelhante Öquela observada para as explos‰es simples, contudo, um n£mero total de elÇtrons emissores de 2-3 ordens de grandeza maior visto que se originam em regi‰es com uma †rea maior que aquela geradora de explos‰es simples. Isto sugere que as explos‰es complexas apresentam um car†ter temporal fragmentado em explos‰es simples

Para investigar a defasagem entre o aumento do fluxo de f¢tons para baixas e altas energias ("high energy lag"), durante explos‰es solares em raios-X, foi aplicado o mesmo procedimento utilizado por Dulk et al., (1992) em 10 eventos intensos (com fluxo de f¢tons significativo para pelo menos 300 keV), observados pelo instrumento WBS/HXS a bordo do satÇlite YOHKOH. Para as explos‰es selecionadas determinou-se a raz∆o: RBA = fluxo (50-100 keV) / fluxo (> 200 keV) para todo o intervalo da explos∆o, com resoluá∆o temporal de 1 segundo e comparou-se com o fluxo total integrado acima de 50 keV. A comparaá∆o preliminar entre o aumento do fluxo de f¢tons para energias menores que 100 keV, com relaá∆o ao fluxo acima de 200 keV, evidenciou tràs comportamentos principais: defasagens de 20-30 segundos, defasagens de 1-5 segundos e ausància de defasagem (dentro da precis∆o de 1 segundo), indicando que as escalas de tempo das emiss‰es em raios-X duros, em diferentes bandas de energia, variam de explos∆o para explos∆o, de acordo com as diferenáas na injeá∆o dos elÇtrons energÇticos

   83:  In this paper we present a study on the coronal hole-active region-current sheet (CHARCS) association with the coronal mass ejections and also with the geomagnetic activity. Attempts have been made to distinguish between the geo-effective and the non-geo-effective CHARCS association on the basis of their characteristic features. lt is shown that these features could be used as an important tool for predicting intense geomagnetic storms We have selected those CMEs that gave rise to intense geomagnetic storms

   83:  The morphological studies of ionospheric D region absorption in midlatitudes showed that the absorption of LF,MF and HF waves increases after the magnetic storm (Lauter, 1958) This midlatitude absorption was clearely sepearated from auroral absorption zone and indicated poleward and equatorward boundaries, the poleward boundary being at L= 2.6-3.5 and equatorward boundary near L= 2 at the time when the recovery phase ohanged from its rapid to slower phase (Wagner and Banta, 1983). Lauter and Knuth (1950) found that there was a permRnant extra ionization lasting upto a fortnight after the onset of the storm. which could be observed during the night, the inrpaspd absorption being maintained by photodetachment processes from negative ions by the precipitating high energy particle Flux No observations are available at low latitudes, particulariv in the Geomagnetic Anomaly Region (GAR), about the change in absorption after a magnetic storm. In the present work. the nbsorption of HF and MF radiowaves after a magnetic storm is studied

   83:  One, of the most useful techniques to observe neutral atmosphere temperature in the mesopause region, between 80 to 100 km, is to measure the molecular rotational temperature of the oxygen emission, O2 (0,0) atmospheric band at 762.0 an and the OH vibration-rotation band, for example OH(8,3) band at 732.0 nm. Ground based observations in these emissions have been carriedout from various stations around the globe and their nocturnal and seasonal variations have been studied. The ground-based observations, however, can not provide information regarding the height of the emission layer. Photometers on board a rocket, measuring in situ the emission spectra makes it possible to observe the height profile of the emissions and their rotational temperatures. The scientific background for carrying out these measurements from an equatorial and/or mid-latitude region and instrumentation to be used will be discussed

Simultaneous ground-based observations of several airglow emissions make it possible to determine the propagation of disturbances in the upper atmosphere, to reveal mutual correlations between atmospheric layers and to investigate the spatial time distribution of the atmospheric composition. In 1970, airglow observations were started at INPE. However, observations of several airglow emissions on a routine basis started in 1975 at Cachoeira Paulista (22.7 degreeS, 45. degreePW)' Brazil, which is situated inside, both the equatorial ionospheric anomaly and the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly

   83:  First Brazilian Scientific Microsatellite SACI-1 is scheduled to be launched in July 1999 in a near circular polar orbit at an inclination of 98 degrees.5 and altitude of 750 km. It will carry a three component fluxgate magnetometer constructed by IGPP/UCLA for measuring three components of the Earth's Magnetic Field in the space at a rate of 10 samples per second. The scientific objective is to study field aligned currents in the aurora[ oval and the electrojet of the equatorial ionosphere. Together with the geomagnetic data from other polar orbiting spacecrafts e.g POLAR, FAST, OERSTED, it will be possible to obtain a truly global picture of field aligned current system. The experimental details and the plans of this project are presented here

   83:  The eleven year solar variability cycle, discovered by A. N. Schwabe in 1843, is well known. This cycle is due to solar magnetic field inversions which periodically increase the solar activity with greater emission of particles and radiation.
Long solar activity variation chronologies were reconstructed from many sources. Schrove (1955) used historical auroral activity and sunspot observation records to estimate magnitudes and years of sunspot number maximum occurrence since 300 D. C. Besides the mean I I yr. cycle, he identified a 78 yr. cycle (named Gleissberg) for sunspot activity, and a 200 yr. cycle for auroral activity. Atmospheric 14C level changes, were also related to solar activity variations (Stuiver and Quay, 1980).

   83:  We have studied ionospheric drifts utilizing digital ionosondes (digisondes). In addition to the regular ionograms, provided by analogical ionosondes, digisondes also provide information about ionospheric drift using a receiving antenna array, shifted echo frequency and phase differences between the receiving antennas of the array. Recorded information is digitally treated by an in house processor which controls all functions of the instrument, generating archives that are post-processed. Post-processed data analysis permitted us to note some interesting ionospheric drifts characteristics on the October 1997 data from Sao Luis.We observed that vertical and zonal drift velocity components behavior is different from that measured by incoherent scatter radar at Jicamarca, Peru, described by Batista et al. (1996) and Fejer et al. (1985). A probable cause for this differentiated behavior is of instrumental origin. Digital ionosonde uses the HF pulses reflection principle and so, during the daytime, drifts measurements are strongly influenced by photoionization production reactions. In this way it indeed measure a so called "apparent velocity". But, around 2100 UT (1800 UT) when the photoionization production ends, the observed vertical drift shows a pre-reversal enhancement peak due to the eletromagnetic drift (E x B), as expected. Zonal drift shows a behavior going from slightly eastward between 12 00 UT and 20 00 UT, to slightly westward after that time. The validation of the digisonde ionospheric drifts at the Brazilian stations will fill the gap on low and equatorial latitude drift measurements, over this region, that is characterized by a large magnetic declination, and that shows remarkable differences from Jicamarca pattern. It will permit to obtain diurnal pattern of the vertical drift (until now dh'F/dt has been used to derive vertical drifts, but this is only valid around sunset), as well as meridional and zonal

   83:  Total ionospheric electron content (TEC) over the brazilian region, was measured using data from Global Positioning System (GPS) dual frequency receivers. The GPS system main purpose is to determine the position and velocity of a fixed or mobile object, placed over or near the earth surface, using the signals of 24 satellites on earth orbit. Due to the effect of the ionosphere on the propagation of the electromagnetic waves transmitted by the GPS satellites, in 1575.42 and 1227.60 MHz, it is possible to obtain the TEC, using the usual data for navigation purpose. The TEC is the amount of free electrons along the path of the electromagnetic wave between each satellite and the receiver. The TEC is an important geophysical parameter, which has also applications for correcting navigation measurements for single frequency receivers. This work presents the methodology utilized to obtain diurnal and latitudinal variations of vertical TEC over the brazilian region

   83:  The Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (National Institute for Space Research) is installing in S∆o Lu°s do Maranh∆o a coherent VHF pulsed Doppler radar system for studying the electrodynamics of equatorial electrojet in Brazil. The system consists of 8 transmitters, 15 kW each one, an array of 16 antennas north-south aligned with 48 dipoles for each one, and a data acquisition system (Janardhanan, 1983). The set of transmitters generate a pulsed signal at 50 MHz which feeds the antennas array and is transmitted to be scattered by ionospheric irregularities at E and F layers height. When the signal finds irregularities in about half wavelength, it is backscattered by those ones and received by the same antenna array. After the signal processing in the receiver system, the result is stored as a digital code. S∆o Lu°s do Maranh∆o was chosen by its geographical placement (2.6 degree S, 44.2 degree W) on the geomagnetic equator. At present the radar is partially operated, collecting data on equatorial electrojet. However some improvements are being done for the complete system operation. Several researches have been done concerning irregularities on geomagnetic equator in Brazil (Abdu et al., 1982; Abdu, 1983; Sobral et al., 1985; Sobral and Abdu, 1991; Batista et al., 1996) and the coherent radar will be another contribution for the important equatorial electrojet study

For the first time negative and positive conductivity profiles with altitude were obtained in Brazil. Along its trajectory the balloon passed over three thunderstorms, as identified by video on-board images. The data give an unique opportunity to study the stratospheric conductivity variations

Este es el primer instrumento instalado en Chile para observaciones sistem†ticas a largo plazo, con el prop¢sito de estudiar el comportamiento y la evoluci¢n de la capa de ozono, en la zona poblada m†s cerca de la Ant†rtica, donde desde hace unos a§os, a comienzo de la primavera Austral se manifiesta el fen¢meno de la formaci¢n del "Agujero de Ozono Ant†rtico" (AOA). En este trabajo se presenta un an†lisis de practicamente cinco a§os de mediciones hechas con el espectrofot¢metro Brewer, como tambiÇn un an†lisis de los meses de septiembre y octubre (1992-1996), de la evoluci¢n de la capa de ozono. Se muestran las mayores disminuciones detectadas hasta este momento sobre Punta Arenas, como por ejemplo el d°a 17 de octubre de 1994 cuando se midieron 145,8 UD (Unidades Dobson), que es el valor m†s bajo medido, en cinco a§os, equivalente aproximado a casi el 60 abajo de la media normal. Se muestra adem†s los resultados de los primeros sondajes de ozono realizados con sondas ECC, realizados en Punta Arenas en octubre de 1995, para an†lisis de la distribu°ci¢n de ozono con la altura

   83:  A network, of UV-B meters has been organized and distributed in Brazil in association with studies of the stratospheric ozone laver and in an effort to increase public awareness of excess UV-B radiation on the human skin. In order to make UV-B measurements more accessible to the people, the UV Index has been calculated in specific cases. Three different kinds of UV-B meters are used. The most sofisticated instruments can measure very narrow spectral ranges, and they can do it almost unattended by operator.Simultaneously they measure stratospheric ozone, Sulfur dioxide and Nitrogen dioxide; these are the Brewer spectrophotometers, six of which are presently part of the network. A second class of instruments is simpler but can also make spectral measurements at different wavelengths; the network has now three GUV meters in this category. And in the third class of instruments there are the UV-Biometers, which are UV-B integrating instruments, less expensive and very convenient for different applications and interpolation purposes. There are presently 8 such instruments in operation. The whole network has recently also expanded to neighbor collaborating countries, Chile and Bolivia. Southern Chile is very interesting for observations of the Antarctic Ozone Hole, and its consequences in terms of increased UV-B and in Bolivia, the high Andes mountains receive high doses of UV-B and UV-A, because of the altitude above sea level. We will show some of these UV results, and show differences in various regions of Brazil

The results are discussed in terms of the polarity of the associated lightning flashes and the relationship between the sferic amplitude and the sferic decay time constant. Sferic signatures of one negative flash and two large positive flashes in the quasi-DC and VLF electric field data, obtained in 1995, are presented. From the data obtained in 1994 associated with negatives flashes, a linear relationship between the amplitude and the decay time constant of sferics was found

The behavior of the vertical electric-field before and after large cloud-to-ground positive lightning flashes is discussed and attributed to the existence of static and transient shielding layers around the thunderstorm. The data just after the flashes can be explained by assuming a static shielding layer around the thunderstorrn correspondent to a decrease in the conductivity inside the cloud by a factor of three or more. The data before the first lightning flash can be explained by assuming a transient shielding layer just above the top of the thunderstorm, produced by the near breakdown field inside the cloud

   83:  Negative cloud-to-ground lightning flashes were recorded by a lightning positioning and tracking system (LPATS) in the region of the Mount Agulhas Negras (altitude of 2787 m) in Brazil, during the winter and summer season of 1993. The dependence of the stroke peak-current on the order of the stroke, the flash multiplicity and the season was investigated. It was found that subsequent strokes tend to be less intense than first-order strokes and that first-order strokes tend to be more intense in multiple stroke flashes. It seems that  the lager is the multiplicity, the higher is the intensity of the first-order stroke. The above results are more evident during the  winter season. It was also found that the geometric mean of the first-order stroke peak-current increases in the winter season. The dependence of the results on the high altitude of the observation site was also investigated. Apparently, the high altitude of Mount Agulhas Negras has an effect on the lightning intensity during the summer season

   83:  About 200,000 lightning flashes recorded in the summer season of 1993 in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were analysed in terms of the predominant meteorological condition in the synoptic scale. The results indicate that most lightning characteristics are independent on the synoptical conditions. However, the mean intensity of first-order strokes in both negative and positive lightning flashes were found to be lower in flashes associated with isolated thunderstorms than in flashes associated with cold front or tropical convection

   83:  In this paper it is analyzed 13 M-component of 11 subsequent return stroke (of order three or higer) of natural negative cloud to ground lightning captured by a 60 m metallic tower of Cemig Research Lightning Station (CLRS) in Brazil. The CLRS has registered M-components in times less then 1.2 millisecond arter the preceding return stroke. The M-components are more intense than those recordered in triggered lightning flashes and occur during periods of higher continuing current level The half peak width was found to shorter than those obtained in triggered lightning flashes

   83:  This paper shows data associated with 50 subsequent return stroke of 22 natural negative descendent lightining discharges in Brazil captured by a 60 m metalic tower, between 1985 and 1994. It is investigated the possible correlations among the time to peak value of the time to peak current, the peak value of the electric current, and the peak value of the derivative current. We discuss some physical consequences relating to them. We suggest that there may be a non-linear correlation between the time to peak occurence and the magnitude of these parameters

   83:  Global and local lightning data in Brazil are revised. Brazil is the largest tropical country of the world and, in consequence, one of the main countries in terms of lightning activity. About 100 million lightning strikes occur each year in almost all parts of the country. From thunderday level and satellite data, it is well known that most of them occur in the Amazon region in association with isolated thunderstorms and tropical squall lines produced by low level convergence known as the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). However, no local ground lightning data are available in this region, so that the lightning characteristics can be determined. In the south and southeastern regions of the country, by turn, the lightning flashes are mainly associated with severe storms produced by cold front convection in a mountainous terrain. In this region, balloon and ground lightning data have been obtained in association with cold frontal squall lines and mesoscale convective complexes. The analysis of these data has identified new exciting aspects of the lightning research, at same time that it has encouraged its development in our country

No Brasil, pesquisas recentes parecem apontar para caracter°sticas peculiares dos relÉmpagos em nosso pa°s. Ao mesmo tempo, os poss°veis efeitos dos relÉmpagos sobre a sa£de humana, os modernos avi‰es, as usinas nucleares e os sofisticados sistemas militares s∆o problemas que tàm merecido crescente interesse.

A dinÉmica ionosfÇrica-termosfÇrica Ç modelada usando o modelo FLIP (Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma) para estudar a propagaáao de padr‰es perturbados de ventos termosfÇricos e as mudanáas na atmosfera neutra que originam as fases negativas em altas latitudes. As tempestades desenvolvidas no m°nimo solar tem efeitos maiores sobre a ionosfera que aquelas desenvolvidas no m†ximo solar. Os efeitos sazonais prevalecem sobre os de ciclo solar em altas latitudes. Na regi∆o de CON, os ventos perturbados prevalecem por v†rios dias, mantendo a altura do pico de ionizaá∆o da camada F2, hmax, alta. Em CP, limax Ç afetada por um efeito local, o vento zonal geogr†fico. Os padr‰es modelados de ventos acompanham as mudanáas de hmax e s∆o de magnitude maior em mÇdias latitudes. Observa-se claramente a propagaá∆o de perturbaá‰es nos ventos associada ao in°cio de sub-tempestades. As mudanáas introduzidas nas concentraá‰es da atmosfera neutra expicam as fases negativas sobre IRJ, mas n∆o sobre CON

   83:  Este artigo trata da obtená∆o do perfil de temperatura atmosfÇrica entre 80 e 100 km de altura, regi∆o da mesopausa. Ele Ç baseado no desenvolvimento e aprimoramento de uma tÇcnica experimental simples que permite determinar a temperatura da atmosfera utilizando um radar de laser e as propriedades f°sicas do s¢dio mesosfÇrico. A tÇcnica consiste em sintonizar o radar de laser na linha D2 do s¢dio (5890 ∂) e substituir o espelho de sa°da do laser por um interferìmetro Fabry-Perot com "free-spectral-range" de 1,98 pin, mesmo valor da separaá∆o da estrutura hiperfina da linha D2 do s¢dio. Inicialmente um controlador de temperatura permite variar a temperatura do Fabry-Perot e realizar urna varredura em comprimento de onda na estrutura hiperfina do s¢dio. Posteriormente um Fabry-Perot controlado por press∆o permite mudar o comprimento de onda do laser do m†ximo para o m°nimo da estrutura hiperfina. A temperatura do s¢dio, ou da atmosfera, urna vez que est∆o em equil°brio termodinÉmico, Ç inferida da convoluá∆o entre o perfil do laser e o perfil ressonante do s¢dio. This paper is about the acquisition of the temperature profile between 80 and 100 km, in the mesopause region. It is based on the development and improvement of a simple experimental technique that enable determine the atmospheric temperature using a lidar and the physical properties of the mesospheric sodium. The technique consist in tune the lidar in the D2 line of the sodium (5890 A) and substitute the output mirror of the laser for a Fabry-Perot interferometer which has the free-spectral-range of 1.98 pm, same value of te separation between the hyperfines components of the D2 line. Inicialy a temperature controler permits to vary the FabryPerot temperature and to do a wavelenght sweeping in the hyperfine structure of the sodium. Subsequently a Fabry-Perot with pressure control enable to change the laser wavelenght between the maximun and the raininum of the hyperfine structure. The sodium, and the atmospheric temperature, once they are in termodinamic equilibrium, are deduced from the convolution between the the laser sp--ctmm and the sodium ressonance profile

   83:  The excitation of Langmuir waves by a gentle bump-on-tail of the electron distributions has become the classic example of a kinetic instability. Clear manifestations of effects of this instability are observed in a number of space objects as solar wind, magnetotails, auroral regions and planetary foreshocks. The purpose of this work is to investigate the possible nonlinear phenomena associated with the Langmuir waves generated by the beam. This paper reports results obtained in a beam plasma experiment as well as some simulation results obtained using the particle-in-cell code PDP1

   83:  Geomagnetic micropulsations as recorded by a network of magnetometers are a useful guide to investigate the complex magnetospheric processes in general and to understand the generation and propagation mechanisms of the ULF waves in particular (Hughes, 1994). In these studies, parametrization of the wave polarization properties is inevitably the first step. The geomagnetic field variations as recorded at the Earth's surface are the vector sum of external (source) and internal current systems, the latter resulting from the electromagnetic induction in the electrically conductive layers of the Earth. In the absence of lateral conductivity variations, the intemal currents are simply the mirror image of the external current system, in the sense that their magnetic effects in the horizontal (X and Y) field components are in-phase with the inducing external source fields. In this idealized case, the polarization and phase properties of the oscillating external signals are uniquely determined from the recorded total fields

   83:  A standard technique to measure the flux of charged particles with different energies and masses is to use a Retarding Potential Analyser (RPA). The front end of the experiment is a window that allows the particles of all energies and masses to enter the detector. These particles pass through a set of grids, where the selection of particles in the required mass and energy range is made. Only particles in this certain energy and mass range finally reach the collector electrode. The current collected by the collector electrode is, therefore a direct measure of the number of particles collected by it. By varying the electric potentials applied to the set of grids one can measure the flux of charged particles in different energy ranges. An RPA experiment is being developed in the Aeronomy Laboratory of INPE, to be used for the measurement of the spectral distribution of thermal and suprathermal electron in the energy range of 0 to 32eV, on board rockets and satellites. Basic details of this experiment are presented here. The experiment can be adapted to measure the spectral distribution of negatively or positively charged particles including electrons in other energy ranges

   83:  During the Guara campaign, conducted from Alcantara in Brazil, a Black Brant X sounding rocket was launched on 14-th October 1994 at 1955hrs (LT) to investigate into the phenomenon of high-altitude equatorial spread-F events. The rocket, as expected passed through an active topside spread-F event, monitored simultaneously by several ground-based instruments. The electron density height profile and the amplitude of the electron density fluctuations were measured simultaneously by three different plasma density probes; a High Frequency Capacitance (HFC) probe, a conventional Langmuir Probe (LP) and a Plasma Frequency Probe (PFP). While the PFP provided the absolute electron density, the LP gave the relative variation in the electron density. The electron density profile obtained from the HFC probe measurements is practically absolute except for a plasma sheath factor. But this technique does not provide the small-scale electron density fluctuation amplitude. Thus, the three experiments provided data, which could be used not only to obtain reliable electron density data, but also could be used to arrive at some of the inherent difficulties associated with each of these techniques. For example the electron density profiles estimated from the HFC and PFP experiments are almost identical except for a small factor varying with altitude. The amplitude of large-scale fluctuations provided by the LP measurements is considerably less than that provided by HFC and PFP. Characteristic features of the high-altitude spread-F as observed by these experiments are presented here

   83:  In-situ measurements of the height variation of the ionospheric electric field and electron density variations were made with a rocket-borne double probe and two different types of electron density probes. A Brazilian made SONDA III rocket launched on 18-th December, 1995 at 2117 hrs (LT) from the equatorial rocket launching station, Alcantara reached an apogee altitude of 557km and covered a horizontal range of 589km. Several ground equipments were operated during the launch campaign with the specific objective of knowing the ionospheric conditions at the time of launch and thereby to launch the rocket into an F-region prone to the presence of large plasma bubbles. The rocket in fact passed through several medium scale plasma bubbles and the electric field double probe and the electron density probes detected the presence of a wide spectrum of electric field and electron density irregularities. In the base of the F-region the electric field double probe measurements clearly indicated the presence of large amplitude fluctuations, closely associated with large amplitude electron density irregularities But in the height region close to the rocket apogee though the electron density profile showed the presence of large scale spatial structures, the electric field measurements did not show fluctuations of similar amplitude. Being a nighttime launch one would expect the electron density irregularities, if generated by the well-known cross-field instability mechanism, in height regions where the electron density gradient is downward, i.e. in the same direction as the ambient Hall electric field. An FFT algorithm was then used to estimate the spectral distribution of the electric field and electron density fluctuations, thus estimating the height variation of the spectral variation. the results of this analysis are presented here

   83:  A magnetometer array study was operated in the north-northeast Brazil as a collaborative exercise between the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE and the Flinders University of South Australia. The analysis and interpretation of the magneto-variational (MV) field data has promoted further the spirit of the international cooperation. This is the first exercise of its kind in the Brazilian shield, aimed at mapping the internal conductivity distribution on a regional scale. The present Paper summarizes the primary features of the conductivity distribution deduced by subjecting the array data to various data processing techniques of GDS (Gough and Geomagnetic Deep Soundings Ingham, 1983; Egbert and Booker, 1993). The tectonic significance of the mapped conductive zones in the geological evolution of the Parnaiba basin is emphasized and possible sources of the enhanced conductivity summarized

   83:  Ozone concentration measurements on board of an aircraft indicated a relatively sharp variation between Curitiba and S∆o Paulo, at a height of 700 mb (3 km), with the relative ozone concentration decreasing by a factor of 2. A possible explanation for our observations is purely chemical, on the basis of the high pollution emissions in the vicinity of S∆o Paulo. Simultaneous meteorological data obtained by radiosoundings lead to two different alternative interpretations. The first of these assumes that the sampled air in S5o Paulo is of marine origin being thus less rich in ozone. The second points out that over Curitiba, the mixing layer had a higher upper limit, with the aircraft exiting the planetary mixing layer just after Curitiba

   83:  Around solar maximum, the dominant interplanetary phenomena causing intense magnetic storms (Dst <-100 nT) are the interplanetary manifestations of fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Two interplanetary structures are important for the development of storms, involving intense southward IMFs: the sheath region just behind the forward shock, and the CME ejecta itself. Whereas the initial phase of a storm is caused by the increase in plasma ram pressure associated with the increase in density and speed at and behind the shock (accompanied by a sudden impulse [SI] at Earth), the storm main phase is due to southward IMFs. If the fields are southward in both of the sheath and solar ejecta, two-step main phase storms can result and the storm intensity can be higher. The storm recovery phase begins when the IMF turns less southward, with delays of approximate to 1-2 hours, and has typically a decay time of 10 hours. For CMEs involving clouds the intensity of the core magnetic field and the amplitude of the speed of the cloud seems to be related, with a tendency that clouds which move at higher speeds also posses higher core magnetic field strengths, thus both contributing to the development of intense storms since those two parameters are important factors in genering the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling via the reconnection process. During solar minimum, high speed streams from coronal holes dominate the interplanetary medium activity. The high-density, low-speed streams associated with the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) plasma impinging upon the Earth's magnetosphere cause positive Dst values (storm initial phases if followed by main phases). In the absence of shocks, SIs are infrequent during this phase of the solar cycle. High-field regions called Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) are mainly created by the fast stream (emanating from a coronal hole) interaction with the HCS plasma sheet. However, because the B-z component is typically highly fluctuating within the CIRs, the main phases of the resultant magnetic storms typically have highly irregular profiles and are weaker. Storm recovery phases during this phase of the solar cycle are also quite different in that they can last from many days to weeks. The southward magnetic field (B-s) component of Alfven waves in the high speed stream proper cause intermittent reconnection, intermittent substorm activity, and sporadic injections of plasma sheet energy into the outer portion of the ring current, prolonging its final decay to quiet day values. This continuous auroral activity is called High Intensity Long Duration Continuous AE Activity (HILDCAAs) Possible interplanetary mechanisms for the creation of very intense magnetic storms are discussed. We examine the effects of a combination of a long-duration southward sheath magnetic field, followed by a magnetic cloud B-s event. We also consider the effects of interplanetary shock events on the sheath plasma. Examination of profiles of very intense storms from 1957 to the present indicate that double, and sometimes triple, IMF B-s events are important causes of such events. We also discuss evidence that magnetic clouds with very intense core magnetic fields tend to have large velocities, thus implying large amplitude interplanetary electric fields that can drive very intense storms. Finally, we argue that a combination of complex interplanetary structures, involving in rare occasions the interplanetary manifestations of subsequent CMEs, can lead to extremely intense storms

   83:  The relationship between rainfall in sub-regions of Uruguay and South Brazil and a finer classification of El Ninos (ENs), was studied. ENSOWs were defined as years when an EN existed on the Peruvian coast, the southern oscillation index (SOI = Tahiti minus Darwin pressure) was negative (SO), and Pacific sea-surface temperature SST) nomalies were positive (W). Further, unambiguous ENSOWs were defined as years when SO and W occurred in the middle of the calendar year, and ambiguous ENSOWs were defined as years when SO and W occurred in the earlier or later part of the calendar year (not in the middle). In contrast with India and some other regions where unambiguous ENSOWs were associated predominantly with droughts, in the case of southern South America the association was with excess rains. Among the ambiguous ENSOWs, some were associated with floods in southern South America, but some had normal or mixed rainfalls (floods in some sub-regions, droughts in others) and a few even had droughts. C events (La Ninas, i.e. no EN, SOI positive, and SST negative) were associated mostly with droughts, but occasionally with floods in southern South America. Many non-events were associated with floods or droughts, indicating that factors other than EN/La Nina could also be important

   83:  About 1.1 million cloud-to-ground lightning flashes were recorded by a lightning positioning and tracking system in southeastern Brazil in 1993. The data have been analyzed in terms of their monthly, seasonal (summer/winter), and diurnal (local time) variations. The monthly variation shows a double peak characteristic of tropical lightning activity. The seasonal variation indicates that most flashes occur in the spring and summer seasons, with less than 25
   83:   occurring in the autumn and winter. The lightning flash polarity and multiplicity were found to be very similar in the summer and winter seasons. Radiation field and direct current lightning data were obtained in towers located in the same region of the network to verify the multiplicity data obtained by the network. The results indicate that the multiplicity obtained by the system is much lower than that obtained by radiation field measurements of close lightning in the same region of Brazil. The lightning flash peak current were found to be larger in the summer than in the winter, in contrast with results obtained in other parts of the world. The diurnal variation of the negative flashes shows in the summer and winter seasons the same behavior, with a peak around 1500-1800 LT, associated with the maximum convective activity in the afternoon. The diurnal variation of positive flashes, in turn, shows this behavior only in the winter. In the summer, it shows a maximum around 1400-1500 LT, with a secondary peak at 1900 LT. However, considering only positive flashes with peak currents higher than 15 kA the diurnal distribution in the summer is similar to that for negative flashes. This fact indicates that the positive flashes with a peak current less than 15 kA are probably intracloud flashes erroneously identified by the network. The results are discussed in association with the findings presented in paper 1 [Pinto et al., this issue] and compared with results obtained in other parts of the world

   83:  The continuous evolution of the transport equations used to describe the wide variety of plasma flow conditions found in all areas of aeronomy and space plasma physics requires improved collision terms to be determined over and over again. Present attention to high flow velocity plasmas has revived this demand. The theoretical problems related with the derivation of reliable collision terms for transport equations of high-speed plasmas are considered at length. An alternative approach to handle the matter properly is discussed and comparisons are performed with currently used methods. It can be appreciated that considerable improvements can be Made as fat as the present understanding of the subject is concerned.

   83:  The interparticle force acting during a binary encounter is usually modeled by a potential of the inverse power law form. The influence of one particle on the other decays with distance and here the effects felt around the so called 'cutoff distance' are considered. Attention is given to the Fokker-Planck model in generalized and restricted forms to describe the collisional consequences of this sort of interaction. Particular emphasis is placed on the peculiar details of the Coulomb collision theory overlooked in earlier works on this matter as: (a) the form of the collision term, (b) the definition of the Coulomb logarithm and (c) the value of the effective cross section. Only the long range effects are focused. To combine close and long ranges into a unique collision term the cross section corresponding to each range must be added. The classical use of the same expression for the cross section in both ranges is shown to be inappropriate. The proposed approach is valid regardless the form of the distribution function, on the magnitude of the flow velocity, besides being applicable to other types of interparticle forces as Maxwell molecule interactions. The material is relevant for solar plasma, interplanetary transport and planetary magnetosphere studies

   83:  The Ondrejov radiospectrograph operating in the 0.8-2.0 GHz frequency range recorded in recent years (1998-2000), three (August 10, 1998; August 17, 1999; June 27, 2000) unique bursts with rapid frequency variations (lace bursts) lasting for several minutes. On August 17, 1999, the same burst was recorded simultaneously by the Brazilian Solar Spectroscope in the 1.0-2.5 GHz frequency range. The frequency variations of these bursts in four time intervals were analyzed by the Fourier method and power-law spectra with power-law indices close to -2 were found. The Fourier spectra show the presence of frequency variations in the 0.01-3.0 Hz interval which indicate fast changes of plasma parameters in the radio source. Due to the similarities in the line features of these bursts with zebra pattern lines, a model similar to that of the zebra pattern was suggested. The model radio spectra, computed using this model with a turbulent state of the solar are atmosphere, are similar to those observed by the radiospectrographs

   83:  The role of solar and geomagnetic declination angles in controlling the mapping of electric fields generated by dynamo action in the non- equatorial latitudes, onto the E- and F-regions over the equatorial latitudes was discussed in detail by Muralikrishna and Abdu (1988). From a comparative study of the daytime variation in the average east-west drift velocity of electrons in the E-region over Jicamarca (0.9ß N dip lat.; 12ß S geograph. lat.), Peru and the variation in the horizontal component of  the geomagnetic field at a nearby station Huancayo, on magnetically quiet days, they concluded that differences in sunrise times between the equatorial latitudes and the magnetically conjugate non-equatorial latitudes caused by the large magnetic declination angle at Jicamarca and the solar declination angle changing with season of the year, influence to a great extent the development of electric fields in the equatorial E- and F-regions. In addition to a strong forenoon-afternoon asymmetry in the strength of the distributed currents above the electrojet region, they reported significant seasonal changes in the intensity of these currents mainly due to the changing solar declination angle acting in conjunction with the large magnetic declination angle

   83:  Measurements of stratospheric conductivity and of electric fields associated with sferics, were obtained during two balloon flights carrying double-probe electric field detectors launched from Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil (geographic coordinates 22ß44', 44ß56'W) on 26 January 1994 and 23 March 1995. From data obtained in 1994, a linear relationship between the vertical quasi-DC electric field peak amplitude and the decay time constant of sferics was found for negative flashes. The results are compared to similar data for intracloud flashes. The data were supported by radar and METEOSAT satellite images. For the first time, positive and negative conductivity vertical profiles were obtained in Brazil. During the flight, at an average altitude of 27.5 kin, the balloon passed over two thunderclouds as identified, by on-board video images and photographs. The simultaneous conductivity measurements and thundercloud on-board observations allowed to determine that the presence of clouds affects the stratospheric negative conductivity, producing a extended and cumulative drop after the balloon passed over each cloud. Based on data obtained in 1995 and on the present knowledge about the differences between positive cloud to ground and intracloud flashes, two methods to distinguish between them in balloon electric field data are presented: the first is based on an estimation of the charge destroyed in the event; the second is based on the ratio between the vertical quasi-DC and the VLF electric field. The behavior of the vertical quasi-DC electric field before and after large cloud-to-ground lightning flashes is discussed and attributed to the existence a shielding layer around the thunderstorm caused by a factor decrease of three or more in the conductivity inside the cloud

The Log-Normal PDF fits better this current data set than the three parameter Weibull PDF. However, in consequence of its representative behaviour, the last one could be very usefull as an index for classification of thunderstorm events

   83:  This paper presents an analysis of negative descendent cloud to ground lightning captured by a 60 m metalic tower between 1995 and 1994 in the "Morro do Cachimbo", research station (43ß 58' 26" W, 20ß 00'3V" S) of the Companhia EnergÇtica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG). Brazil. From the comparison of return strokes with those of another station in Switzerland, it was noted that electric current wave forms are similar in both countries, although the mean peak current in Brazil (41 kA) is greater than that in Switzerland (30 kA) and the time to peak is greater in Brazil (22 Ês) than in Switzerland (13 Ês). Differences in subsequent strokes were observed too. It was found that the time to peak current is correlated to the time to peak of derivative current with a linear correlation cocficient of about 94
   83:  .The mean third return stroke current was found to be stronger than the second and an explanation for that was suggested. M-components recorded at about 200 Ês (geometric mean peak current of 2.37 kA) had time to peak lower than those obtained after 1 ms; in Florida and Alabama

   83:  Cloud-to-ground lightning flash characteristics in the southeastern Brazil were determined during two months based on data obtained by two different lightning location systems. In December 1995, the data were obtained by a lightning positioning and tracking system (LPATS), version III, and in December 1997, by a new hybrid lightning location methodology combining time-of-arrival (LPATS) and direction-finding techniques (Impact sensors). The results indicate that the flash characteristics are quite different from 1995 to 1997, mainly for positive flashes. Although limited to the small data sample, we believe that the most differences are mainly due to differences in the systems. We suggest that other independent techniques should be used in order to evaluate the performance of such systems

   83:  Covering the period from 22 September through 4 October 1986, the SUNDIAL-86 Solar-Minimum Equinoctial Campaign studied the behavior of the global-scale ionosphere. The period covered the most quiet (Q1) and second most disturbed (D2) days of the entire month of September, with the disturbed conditions triggered by a high-speed solar wind stream. Ionospheric responses were monitored by the SUNDIAL network of nearly 70 stations distributed approximately in three longitudinal domains ; and global maps of f0 F2 results were compared with the << predictions >> of the International Reference Ionosphere modified to include an empirical specification of auroral oval boundaries and associated high-latitude morphological domains. Comparisons that included regions in the polar cap, diffuse auroral oval, mid-latitude trough, equatorial anomaly and the sunrise/sunset terminator showed good agreement between the hourly 8-day-averaged ionospheric observations and the model. The inclusion of an auroral oval and the good agreement between model contours of f0F2 and SUNDIAL observations adds to the quality and applicability of the IRI and builds a foundation for the development of an adaptive time-dependent empirical model to describe global-scale ionospheric responses to storm dynamics

This software can be used in the next missions developed by INPE. The original method developed by Eckel and Vinh was presented without numerical results in that paper. Thus, the modifications considering cases with different geometries, the implementation and the solutions using this method are contributions of this work. The software was tested in real applications with success.

   83:  In this paper multiwavelength observations of an impulsive flare of May 9, 1991 are presented. This event was observed with the 48 GHz multibeam focal array used at the Itapetinga radio telescope, the microwave patrol telescopes at Bern and the BATSE high time resolution hard X-ray spectrometer on board CGRO. While spatially unresolved low sensitivity observations show two major impulsive peaks, the mm-wave observations with the ability of spatially high resolved tracking of the emission centroids suggest a primarily bipolar source configuration. For the first time two mm-wave sources with a spacing below the HPBW could be separated with the multibeam technique. The general features of the observations are explained as emission of partially trapped electrons. Furthermore we present evidence for highly inhomogenous substructures within one of the two mm-wave sources for which the positional scatter of the emission center, within 2 s, is less than 2''

   83:  Observations of solar bursts using the multiple-beam technique define unambiguously the fast time structures present in the flux time profiles, providing, at the same time, their spatial positions. A method was developed to identify these structures and was used in the analysis of two solar events observed at 48 GHz. The bursts' energy content at different time intervals was found to be directly proportional to the number of structures in the same intervals, confirming earlier findings that the microwave burst emission is quantized in energy. The discrete structures are found to be spatially scattered, exhibiting angular separations of up to 25 ". The results favor models of plasma instabilities that produce multiple discrete elementary energy injections scattered in space and time

   83:  We present maps of BL Lac obtained from geodetic VLBI data from the archive of the Washington correlator. The observations were made from 1996 March to 1996 November, with periods from one experiment to another as short as 1 month. The dominant structure of the maps is given by a superluminal component (C2) moving predominantly at position angle similar to 190 degrees. At the later epochs a new superluminal component (C3) emerges from the core and moves along a trajectory at a higher position angle (200 degrees). We also include maps from observations made in 1995 June and August showing the main component (C2) in the early stages of its evolution, as well as an older component (C1). The position angle of the component C1 is nearly the same as that of the new component C3. The component C2 shows indications of nonradial motion, which is discussed in terms of a helically distorted jet. The best fit was obtained for a half-opening angle of the jet of 2.degrees 6 and an angle of the helical axis to the line of sight of 17 degrees

   83:  As part of the preparation for the Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia, a meso-scale modelling study was executed to highlight deficiencies in the current understanding of land surface atmosphere interaction at local to sub-continental scales in the dry season. Meso-scale models were run in 1-D and 3-D mode for the area of Rondonia State, Brazil. The important conclusions are that without calibration it is difficult to model the energy partitioning of pasture; modelling that of forest is easier due to the absence of a strong moisture deficit signal. The simulation of the boundary layer above forest is good, above deforested areas (pasture) poor. The models' underestimate of the temperature of the boundary layer is likely to be caused by the neglect of the radiative effects of aerosols caused by biomass burning, but other factors such as lack of sufficient entrainment in the model at the mixed layer top may also contribute. The Andes generate patterns of subsidence and gravity waves, the effects of which are felt far into the Rondonian area. The results show that the picture presented by GCM modelling studies may need to be balanced by an increased understanding of what happens at the meso-scale. The results are used to identify key measurements for the LBA atmospheric meso-scale campaign needed to improve the model simulations. Similar modelling studies are proposed for the wet season in Rondonia, when convection plays a major role

It is also known that the success of any telecommunication project is the use of the correct media to each task. Operators have a clear sight of such a media adequacy in traditional systems, but not necessarily in the case of Mobile Satellite Systems. This creates a risk that a wrong market objective operator causes trouble to other systems. This paper deal with the sharing alternatives for up to four CDMA MSS operating in the sane frequency band, and analyses both: satellite to user downlink and user to satellite uplink. The influence of several items in capacity is here neared The scope includes: downlink power flux density; code availability; single system internal interference: inter-system interference: diversity schemes: avenge link impairments, margin

   83:  In this paper, we study the effects of the atmospheric drag in swing-by maneuvers. Our goal is to simulate a large variety of initial conditions for those orbits and study them according to the effects caused by this close approach. The practical importance of this topic is to allow mission designers to explore close approaches with planets, as well as to take advantage of the atmospheric effects, when it is possible. We use the well-known planar restricted circular three-body problem plus atmospheric drag as our model. We integrate numerically the equations of motion forward and backward in time, until the spacecraft is in a distance that we can neglect the planet's effect and consider the system formed by the Sun and the spacecraft as a two-body system. At these two points we can use the two body celestial mechanics to compute energy, angular momentum and the Jacobian constant before and after the close approach

Remote observations from satellites will help the development and slow the reduction of natural resources including the rain forest. The National Institute for Space Research-INPE has carried out two satellite programs with this in mind. One of these programs, the SSR consists of two 200 Kg satellites under the Brazilian Complete Space Mission-MECB. The second of these program is the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellites-CBERS. These two programs together combine a powerful and unique imagery capability concerning temporal resolution, spatial resolution and several spectral bands. This paper describes these programs highlighting the applications and data distribution policy

It involves eight 200 kg satellites in an equatorial constellation at 2000 km and can supply low orbit communication for equatorial countries. An equatorial belt from latitude around 30 degree south to 30 degree north is covered. The area includes all remote regions near of the equator where low orbit communication can play an important role. Although this system has been planned on the basis of a Brazilian market it can also provide similar services to other equatorial countries

   88:  body frame
   83:  This paper deals with the problem of rigid body rotation evolution under the action of a torque which depends on the projections of rigid body angular velocity onto the body frame only. This is the so called rigid body with self-excitation. If the magnitude of the torque is arbitrary, the solution to the problem is known in the simplest cases only. The problem with small self-excitation is considered in the paper. This problem is of great importance from the standpoint of a number of applications in spacecraft and rigid body dynamics. Perhaps the most important example is spinstabilized spacecraft rotation evolution due to an internal disturbing torque. In the case of a small torque, it is possible to use perturbation methods to obtain complete analytical and geometrical descriptions of the rotation. In this paper, the common approach to investigating the problem of rigid body rotation under the action of a small torque known in the body frame is described. Using this approach, two problems are solved: the problem of maintaining the angular velocity of a gyroscope using a control torque quadratic in the angular velocity (the problem of Grammel for the case of a small torque), and the problem of asymmetric spacecraft rotation evolution with an electric propulsion thruster

   83:  The swing-by maneuver uses a close approach with a celestial body to modify the velocity, energy, and angular momentum of a spacecraft. The literature has several papers studying this problem, usually using a patched-conic approximation. In the present paper the swing-by maneuvers are studied and classified under the model given by the three-dimensional restricted three body problem. To show the results, the orbits of the spacecraft are classified in four groups: elliptic direct, elliptic retrograde, hyperbolic direct and hyperbolic retrograde. Then the modification in the orbit of the spacecraft caused by the close approach is shown in plots that specify from which group of orbits the spacecraft is coming and to which group it is going. Several families of orbits are found and shown in detail. The effect of every parameter involved in this problem is studied individually. The results generated here have a potential use to solve optimal problems, such as finding trajectories that satisfy some given constraints (such as achieving an escape or capture) with some parameters being extremized (position, velocity, etc.). Two optimal problems are solved in this paper to show this application

   83:  The hydraulic properties of some Amazonian soils differ significantly from the properties of the temperate soils. Most of the soil water release functions implemented in the atmospheric models used in deforestation studies were developed for temperate soils. It is necessary to check the validity of these soil water models with in situ data. In this study, the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study (ABRACOS) soil data have been used to modify the parameter values of Clapp and Hornberger's water release model. Different relations between hydraulic parameters and texture are proposed. These relations are included in the ISBA land surface scheme which is used to simulate the long-term evolution of the soil water content and the surface energy balance of three contrasting ABRACOS sites: two pasture sites with distinct soil properties and a forest site. The sensitivity of the simulations to the use of either the original Clapp and Hornberger water release model or the ABRACOS-derived one is shown

   83:  Total ozone and associated temperature variations on the Southern Oscillation timescale have been investigated using monthly total ozone mapping spectrometer and temperature data for the latitudinal domain between 70 degrees N and 70 degrees S and from 1979 to 1991. The first two modes for total ozone describe the anomalous total ozone patterns associated with the extremes in the Southern Oscillation. The first mode has the largest loadings in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) subtropics and midlatitudes with an east-west dipole in antiphase with a tropical east-west dipole. The second mode has its largest loadings in the tropics with an east-west dipolar pattern. These modes are intimately related to variations in the mean temperature in the lower stratosphere, and this relation is such that the total ozone and mean temperature anomalies are positively correlated. The tropospheric temperature patterns are confined in the tropics, where temperature and total ozone anomalies are negatively correlated. The tropical temperature and total ozone variations are driven by modulations in the tropical convection associated with the Southern Oscillation. The Southern Oscillation signals in the stratospheric temperature and in the total ozone are strongest in the SH midlatitudes during the winter-spring period and precede the extremes in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) by a few months. Thus the total ozone index, defined similarly to the SOI, seems to be more appropriate than the SOI to monitor the stratospheric temperature in the extratropics, in particular in the SH middle to high latitudes

   83:  Long hydrological records, from the Amazon Basin, northeastern Brazil, and northwestern Peru spanning most of this century, are examined for trends in rainfall
(three wettest months) and runoff (three months of highest flow) or stage, where no rating curves exist. Trends are tested for significance using the Mann-Kendall statistic. In basins where large soil, aquifer, or man-made reservoirs give rise to appreciable over-year storage, flows and water levels may be serially correlated. Where serial correlation exists, the usual statistical tests (linear regression, t-test, and Mann-Kendall) will overestimate the significance of trends, showing significance where none exists. Analysis for trend therefore requires particular care when data are serially correlated, and to avoid misleading results, additional supportive evidence must be sought. For example, rainfall records within the same river basin can be checked for trends; serial correlation in rainfall records, in particular, is less likely to be present, so the validity of any trends in rainfall is less open to question. Strong negative trends were found in flow data from the coast of northern Peru and the Sao Francisco River, while positive significant trends were detected in the Parnaiba River basin. No significant trends were found in the discharge or stage records from Amazonia, while rainfall in northeastern Brazil shows a slow increase over long periods. In the Parnaiba and in some rivers of
northern Peru unusually large discharges at the beginning or end of the records seem to account for the direction and significance of trend

   83:  The evolving intraseasonal (IS) modes of the zonally symmetric (ZS) part (the latitudinal profile) of the 200-hPa stream function have been determined by performing extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) analyses for the northern hemisphere (NH) summer and winter. In each analysis the first EEOF mode describes an oscillation with a period of about 50 days. The prominent feature of the upper tropospheric stream function latitudinal profiles, for both seasons, is the propagation of the largest loadings in both hemispheres from near the equator toward higher latitudes. This propagation is more evident during the NH winter and throughout the year in the southern hemisphere (SH). In the NH the poleward propagation of the loadings is more conspicuous within the equator and the 30 degrees N latitudinal band. The associated patterns for the zonally asymmetric (ZA) part of the sea level pressure and the 850- and 200-hPa zonal winds have also been determined. These patterns feature, in general, the largest correlations in the tropics and a large-scale zonal wavenumber one structure propagating continuously eastward around the globe with a 50-day period. The ZA patterns for certain variables show strong seasonal dependence. The 850-hPa ZA zonal wind patterns feature the largest correlations approximately along the climatological position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, whereas the largest correlations for the upper level ZA zonal wind patterns are found near the equator, mainly in the winter hemisphere

   83:  The Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) field experiment was conducted in central Brazil and southern Amazonia during the period August 15 to September 20, 1995, This paper presents an overview of atmospheric conditions during the SCAR-B period. A meteorological office was established in Brasilia to support the mission flights and field activities. All the meteorological data collected during the SCARE have been archived and are available to the scientific community. The meteorological conditions throughout the SCAR-B period of August and September 1995 were near climatological conditions. Few synoptic-scale waves traveling from southeastern Pacific reached Brazil, therefore the SCAR-B period was characterized by long periods of low humidity, dryness, little cloudiness, or rain, and haze events. The stable situation was interrupted due to the penetration of a frontal system on September 20, 1995, and a second and more rain-producing one on September 28, 1995. Those two frontal systems in a period of 10 days brought an end to the dry season. Air particle trajectories show that most of the smoke below 4 km from Amazonia was transported to the south and then to the east exiting the continent at 25 degrees S-30 degrees S. Radiative transfer calculations carried out for the clear sky gaseous and aerosol atmosphere show the decrease of the solar radiation absorption in the atmosphere-surface system due to smoke aerosol loading at the value from 5 to 50 W m(-2) depending on the aerosol optical thickness, single-scattering albedo, and solar zenith angle

   83:  A transport model for the estimation-of tracers spreading from biomass burning areas has been developed on the basis of the semi-Lagrangian technique. The model consists of a three-dimensional Lagrangian form transport equation for tracers and uses the quasi-monotone local cubic-spline interpolation for calculation of unknown values at irregular points. A mass-conserving property of the model is based on the flux-corrected transport method using the algorithm of Priestley. The transport of the smoke particles from Amazonia was simulated for the period from August 20 to 29, 1995. During this period the air mass located below 2 km moved to the south and carried the smoke particles until 30 degrees S

   83:  The impact of smoke aerosols on the surface solar irradiance in the Rondonia region of Brazil is examined. The climate of this region is subequatorial with two distinct seasons; There is a sharp decline of the precipitation and cloudiness during the dry season which lasts from June to September accompanied by anthropogenic burning of savanna and forest in August and September with the resultant strong emission of smoke into the troposphere. Thus the magnitude of the column aerosol optical depth increases in these months while both precipitable water and cloud amount decrease in accordance with the seasonal cycle of humidity. All these atmospheric constituents influence the magnitude of the solar irradiance at the surface. In order to assess the aerosol and gaseous effects on the surface irradiance as compared with impact of cloudiness, we performed the clear-sky radiative transfer model calculations by employing a broadband radiation code and both aerosol optical depth and precipitable water retrieved from Sun photometer measurements. Calculation results show that the elevated aerosol optical depth observed in Rondonia during August and September causes a negative trend in the daily mean clear-sky surface solar irradiance during this period. Since the daily mean solar irradiance measured at the surface under all-sky conditions demonstrates a similar negative trend, it can be explained by the aerosol influence while the effect of clouds appears in the daily variations of the irradiance. It was also shown that smoke aerosols cause a decrease of the monthly mean values of all-sky surface irradiance in August and September as compared with July and October. Corresponding decreases in the near surface air temperature due to the smoke aerosols were not found

   83:  Formerly, investigations on the feasibility of an autonomous orbit control concept have been carried out within a cooperation frame between INPE and CNES. In that study the performance ofa procedurefor autonomous control of the Equator longitude phase drift ( Lo) control has been analyzed. The use of the DIODE (French autonomous orbit determination system, based on the DORIS tracking system) like navigator has been considered, in order to provide, in real time, the orbit estimates needed to feedback the control system. The obtained results, presented in previous papers, gave the motivation to drive the study to the investigation on the performance of an autonomous control concept considering the use of the GPS (Global Positioning System) to provide the autonomous orbit estimates. The GPS system is wide-world spread and its use is increasingly being consideredfor manyfuture Earth missions as on-board navigation system. This paper presents and analyses the results obtained when the use of the coarse GPS navigation solution, (Gill, 1997), is considered in the autonomous orbit control system

Apesar de dificuldades oráament†rias crìnicas, situa-se entre os £nicos 15 pa°ses do mundo a terem desenvolvido com sucesso um satÇlite, disp‰e de um dos 14 centros de lanáamento de satÇlites operacionais em todo o mundo, e ser† em breve provavelmente o nono pa°s a dispor de seu pr¢priove°culo lanáador de satÇlites. Em funá∆o destas posiá‰es j† conquistadas, intensificam-se constantemente as manifestaá‰es de interesse e as oportunidades de novos projetos em parceria internacional, entre as quais certamente destaca-se aquela de tornar-se o £nico pa°s em desenvolvimento a participar da Estaá∆o Espacial Internacional.This article argues that in recent years space activities are increasingly involving not only scientific and technological agents but also economic and political ones. Differently from the bipolarity of the Cold War era, the present stage is characterized by the variety not only of nations, but also of entrepreneurial groups taking part in multinational endeavors. In this increasingly complex and dynamic scene, the need for strategical rationale becomes clear, even more when the relevance of space activities for Brazil is taken into account. The main guidelines for the national initiatives in the area must be based on a deep understanding of the international context of space activities. Presently, the Brazilian space activities are guided by the National Policy for the Development of Space Activities and the National Program of Space Activities, with actions coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB). As a result of strategical decisions made in the past, Brazil occupies today a relevant role in the space segment world scenario. Although having to face continuous budgetary constraints, it is among the only 15 countries in the world that successfully developed a satellite, it has one of the 14 operational satellite's launch centers in the world, and it will soon become the ninth country to have its own satellite launching vehicle. As a consequence of the position it has attained in the international space scene, Brazil has been facing a growing number of offers and opportunities to take part of projects in cooperation with foreign partners. Among those, the opportunity to become the only developing country to participate of the International Space Station program should be highlighted

Grande parte dessa pesquisa vem sendo feita por cientistas da †rea de ciàncias espaciais e atmosfÇricas (CEA) do Instituto Nacional de Pes-quisas Espaciais (INPE). Considerando as dimens‰es continentais do Brasil, o corpo da †rea de ciàncias espaciais e atmosfÇricas do INPE Ç relativamente pequeno e isso demonstra a necessidade de se criar outros centros de pesquisas espaciais no pa°s. Baseados em tal necessidade, cientistas da CEA tomaram a iniciativa de incentivar o desenvolvimento de novos n£cleos de pesquisas espaciais junto a algumas universidades e instituiá‰es depesquisa nacionais. O sucesso de tal esforáo, entretanto, n∆o depende s¢ dos cientistas mastambÇm do governo, por se tratar de uma ciància b†sica. Esse artigo focaliza a importÉnciada ciància espacial tanto para a geraá∆o do conhecimento cient°fico como para ajudar a melhor assessorar a sociedade.

ABSTRACT: Scientific research on our planet's space environment has been conducted in Brazil for the last three decades. Most of this research has been accomplished by scientific groups of the Space and Atmospheric Science Area of the National Institute for Space Reserarch (INPE). Considering the continental dimension of Brazil, the size of INPE's space and atmospheric science group is very modest indeed, which highlights the need to have a broader base of science community spread over the country. INPE's scientists have taken
important initiatives, especially during the last ten years , to encourage and establish space science education and training programs in Brazilian universities and research institutions. However, the success of such efforts do not depend entirely on INPE's scientists. Since space science is basically seen as a fundamental science, not withstanding its multisided and eventual benefits to the society, political willpower on the part of the government is important to guaranty success in such efforts. This article focus on the importance of space science education and research to improve our understanding of the diverse problems of space environment in Brazil, and for the eventual use of such knowledge in many space activity based solution to human/societal problems. By space sciences it is understood here the sciences of earth's atmosphere including the ionosphere (but not including meteorological domain), the magnetosphere, the interplanetary space, solar-terrestrial relationship, and the galactic and extra-galactic space. This article covers also programs and developments of scientific payloads for balloons, rockets and satellites, but does not cover technology aspects of rocket and satellite platforms. The importance of space science studies in Brazil is highlighted through practical examples, from our experience, of the need of information, stemming from such studies, to private firms, national and international scientific communities. Examples will be cited of problems arising from the space environmental characteristics unique to Brazilian territory such as the ionospheric plasma bubble phenomenon that cause strong interference on space based telecommunication systems. Besides the practical need to know about the influence of space phenomena in our day to day life it is pointed out that the study of space sciences is important also for a better understanding of the different processes that control our space environment. Other points of importance to the study of space sciences addressed here include some suggestions to improve the development of this branch of science in Brazil. Because space phenomena do not posses international frontiers the field of space science investigations constitute natural
subject of common interest to many countries. This situation can stimulate international
collaboration projects and political/diplomatic approximation among countries. Since the early years of space research present Brazilian space environment has offered challenging opportunities for numerous experimental campaigns initiated by many foreign countries, notably, USA, Germany and Japan, with the active participation and collaboration of Brazilian scientists.

Especially their algorithm to solve the integer ambiguity problem is reformulated in order to overcome a restriction to non-slow spin rates. The approach is based on the kinetic constraint due to the spin stabilization. Also a closed-jorm ispresented to solve the signal ambiguity which appears whenprocessing the double-difference ofcarrierphase. It is obtainedfrom invariant properties ofvectors under finite rotations. Numerical results are presented using simulated data and real datafrom a ground experiment

   83:  This work deals with the attitude dynamics of the second Brazilian Scientific Satellite SACI-2. This is a low Earth orbit (LEO) micro satellite with scientific purposes. The satellite stabilization procedure combines spin stabilization technique with geomagnetic control to point the spacecraft solar panel towards the Sun and to keep this attitude during the satellite lifetime. The Brazilian Launcher Vehicle will launch the spacecraft by June 1999. The satellite will be injected into its orbit at 120Ò 15 RPM. The spacecraft hasfour mechanical arms to be deployed in orbit. This is to keep the sensors away from the satellite electronics. Another purpose of the mechanical arms is to guarantee the satellite to have the spin axis as the axis of major moment of inertia. The main purpose of this paper is the study of the critical rates of inertia, their effects on the satellite nutation just after its separation from the rocket last stage, and to analyze the critical timefor deploying the arms to avoid the undesirableflat spin motion

   83:  The main goal of this work is to investigate simplified models to determine in real time the orbit of an artificial satellite, using single frequency GPS measurements. This model should be compact providing standard precision at low cost. Cowell's method has been used to propagate the orbit state vector. The modeledforces are geopotential up to 23rd order and degree of the spherical harmonic coefficients. To propagate the state covariance matrix, it has been considered a more simplified model than the one used in dynamical model. For computing the state transition matrix, it is considered only keplerian motion. To estimate an orbit in real time the extended Kalman filter has been used throughout this paper. Many tests are carried out starting from the simplest two body model and varying the contribution sources of the errors to be considered. In order to assess the results, the estimated orbitfor several cases is compared with a full reference Kalman filter, for the Topex/Poseidon satellite

After a search in the literature and analysis of the results available, we select and extend a method developed by Altman and Pistiner to be the base to the algorithm developed. The spacecraft is supposed to be in Keplerian motion controlled by the thrusts, that are assumed to be impulsive with errors in magnitude and direction. Results of simulations are also presented, to show the extrafitel and time required to complete the maneuver, as functions ofthose errors

   83:  The launch of the second INPE's environmental data collecting satellite, SCD2, is reliminarily scheduled for May 1998, by the American Pegasus launcher. This satellite is similar to the SCD2-A, whose launch, in November 2, 1997, by the Brazilian VLS launcher unfortunately, failed. When compared with the SCD1, the SCD2 presents important differences related mainly to attitude stabilization and control. This paper presents an analysis of the main differences between both satellites and discusses their impacts on the flight dynamics system and related operations. For instance, the restriction on spin-axis attitude is, for the SCD2, more stringent than the ones imposed on the SCD1, requiring the application of a Quarter-Orbit Magnetic Attitude Control procedure (QOMAC). The spin-axis attitude control of SCD2 is detailed and its performance is analyzed with the help of available simulation results. Finally, the planning of the flight dynamics operations for the LEOP and routine phase of the SCD2 is described

   83:  A batch least-squares procedure for coarse orbit and attitude determination of LEO spin stabilized satellites is presented. The observations are the axial and radial components of the geomagnetic field and the Sun angle only. The spin axis is considered inertial during sample periods offew tens of minutes. The state propagation and its transition matrix evaluation are carried out by their two-body problem closed-form. The geomagnetic field model considers the full set of IGRF coefficients, and its partial derivatives are evaluated numerically. The initial state is obtainedpnoin Me geomagnetic field intensity range observed during up to one orbit. Two orbit inclination cases were simulated: 25' degreesand 98o. The results are compatible with those obtained by other magnetometer-based procedures for three-axis stabilized satellites. Resultsfrom inflight data of Data Collecting Satellite SCD-1 presented position errors about 100

   83:  This work discusses and simulates the discrete-time control of artificial satellites with flexible appendages, and its stability in function of growing sampling periods. Due to mission needs the dimensions of the appendages tend to increase becoming moreflexible. As a result, it is important to investigate the effects ofdigital characteristics such as sampling period, delays (in inputs, processing and outputs) and amplitude quantization on it. In this work only the sampling period effects are investigated. The discrete-time PD controller design is done considering aspects such as the aliasing and the hidden oscillations. It is tested with models ofan harmonic oscillator and a ofthe CBERS I (ChinaBrazil Earth Resources Satellite), comparing the analog PD with discrete-time PDs obtained by standard s-z mappings (Tustin and Schneider) and by a new mapping, using the same gains for them. Root-loci, transient and steady-state responses were used to analyze their performances. These suggest partial methods of stabilization; and that the new mapping has the bestperformance among the mappings tested

   83:  Feedforward neural networks are investigated in this work to verify its ability to control the attitude of a satellite. Neural nets are a promising tool for attitude control due to its inherent nonlinear behavior, which makes them a natual candidate to control nonlinear systems. Nevertheless, as will be shown, to obtain a neural 3 axis attitude control is not as simple as a conventional SISO net control. Main difficulties are the large amount of training data, in order to assure the complete understanding of the attitude, dynamics by the neural net, and also the fact that attitude control is a MIMO iastead of a SISO system.  Regaedless of these draw backs, some results concerning attitude control will be shown

   88:  frozen orbit
   83:  CBERS (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) marks the beginning of the operational remote sensing satellite era in Brazil. The mission objectives are directed towards the optimum and effective management of National natural resources. The other objective is to utilize the datafrom CBERS in conjunction with supplementary or complementary injbrmation from other resources for survey and management of important areas such as agriculture, geology and forestry. The nominal orbitfor CBERS is repetitive, polar and near circularfirozen orbit at an altitude of 770Km. The mission requirements imposed stringent accuracy on orbit computation system. Precise orbit maintenance is the mandatory mission requirement. Orbit maintenance maneuvers assures all nodes of 373 orbits in 26-day repeat ground track remain within a 20km equatorial longitude bandwidth. The other requirement is to maintain the local time within a small window of Ò10 minutes. Orbit determination, maneuver execution, atmospheric prediction errors and third body perturbation effects limit overall targeting performance. The paper emphasizes the effects of the drag modeling errors due to solar activity especially the 27-day outlook of the 10. 7cm solarflux, and the complexity in ground track maintenance in presence of high solar activity during the lifetime of CBERS. The paper further describes the maneuver strategy and the mathematical modeling applied for orbit maintenance essentially for keeping frozen orbit throughout the operational life. Our choice of appropriate force modeling and computation ofprecise decay rates is described. Performance was measured by predictions against real world satellites. This paper is the result of the orbit keeping maneuver analysis performed for CBERS satellite constellation and the algorithms presented are being implemented in the operations control center

   83:  Workstation based software package has been developedfor Flight Dynamics analysis and spacecraft mission support for CBERS (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) mission. Flight dynamics analysis is the process of generating information related to the position and orientation of a spacecraft relative to a selectedframe of reference, predicting mission critical events and monitoring on-board subsystems. Analysis consists of navigation and trajectory analysis, attitude analysis along with the acquisition and processing of data. In the past this activity was performed through groups of tasks and analysts acting in parallel on several types of computer platforms, which led to many operational difficulties. In this context an integrated approach along with visual interfaces to provide quick and near real time decision oriented flight dynamics software system is designed. The impetus of such design is initiated to meet the mission requirements of CBERS. Many mission analysis and post-flight performance of various subsystems can be represented through visual aids. One of the prominent and significant activities has been implemented for orbit maintenance of CBERS. Definitive orbit parameters are computed every day and are stacked in the history database along with necessary orbit parameters. The ground track shift with reference to nominal longitude and the deviations observed along with correlation of solar activity is represented through visual representation. This paper focuses the flight dynamics software system overview, process and details along with brief mathematical details of its components. Further the paper outlines the envisaged visual tools provided for operational ease and convenience, and an assessment of maneuver performance in real time through attitude monitoring and orbit event history. The software system acts as a convenient tool for post-flight analysis of orbit behavior and orbit control, on-board performance verification of some of the subsystems and attitude sensor monitoring. Details and capabilities offlight dynamics support system for CBERS is presented

This work introduces a numerical study for mission oj'scientific vehicle reentry into Earth atmosphere (ballistic trajectory). The procedure analyzes numerically the vehicle trajectory taking into account those critical points, from orbital injection time up to opening time of parachute, providing the best (in some sense) reentry window using iterative methods. The dynamic models arefully reftrenced to Inertial system (not usual) applicable to orbit and reentry propagation, including disturbing forces due to 6th zonal and tesseral harmonics ofgravitationalfield, aerodynamic forces and trustforce (Guedes, 1997). The vehicle is supposed to have capability of stable aerodynamic flight (longitudinal axis aligned with velocity relative to atmosphere). The simulation of mean trajectory (ballistic type), has presented pointing errors over defined landing point lower than 10 kin without trajectory correction maneuvers

   88:  Proof-Mass Actuator
   83:  The paper presents the results of an active structural vibration control of a flexible satellite performed by a proof-mass actuator (PMA) during an attitude rotation maneuver. The satellite investigated is composed ofa rigid rub plus a cantilevered flexible beam with the PMA located at the beam free end. As the satellite manouvers from rest to a predefined position, the rigid body motion can excite the flexible part of the satellite. The PMA tasks is to damp-out any residual vibration caused by this manouver efficiently. The rigid1flexible satellite is modeled, using a relatively simple structural dynamics approach. Having found the vibration modes of the structure, expressions for kinetic and potential energy are derived. Lagrange's equation is then applied to obtain the satellite equations of motion. The PMA gain selection is based on an analytical approach which shows that the pole and zero of thefundamental mode is dominant. The efficiency of the PMA using velocity feedback with a PI control law was examined by numerical simulations for different control maneuvers strategies. It was shown that one such controller has damped the residual flexible vibration successfully. However, it was also shown that the control system efficiency is function of the maneuver strategy

   83:  This work intends to show some aspects about the mechanical layout and modeling of a BAPTA (Bearing and Power Transfer Assembly) mechanism in development involving a government institution (INPE) and private companies. The design here described is being evolved for application in small satellites (0.5 kW with a rigid solar panel of 1.0 kgM2) . The selected concept uses a conventional 1.8 degrees stepper motor and a 100:1 harmonic drive reduction gearing to achieve a theoretical output step size of 0. 018 degrees. Simulations in computer are showing that significant interaction with the solar array and spacecraft can be avoided (spacecraft pitch disturbing velocity is lower than 10 3 deg/sec) with power consumption as low as 3 to 5 W. The adequate determination of the power consumption is possible due to a adequate representation of magnetic non-linearity in the motor, including its effect on electromagnetic torque production. The reliable prediction of the important dynamic characteristics of the motor and general system necessitates a precise representation oftheflux-linkage data. A good example is the single-step damping, which can be predicted satisfactorily only if the current disturbance and associated power loss in each stator circuit are calculated correctly. This requires that the rate of change offlux-linkage be defined accurately for any combination of the system variables

However, a disturbing torque appears during the propulsion due to unintentional misalignments of the thrust axis with respect to the center of mass. The present paper makes a simplified analytical study of the disturbing torque influences on the trajectory of the center of mass, in the absence of active attitude control. Some conclusions are drawn of this study, for example, the maximum time of propulsion actuation such as to reduce the undesirable effects

The paper is divided into four parts. The first part explains in brief the SCD1 mission, its ground and space segments and the principal characteristics of its launch system. The second part, i.e. the pre-launch preparation of the software, describes the structure of the ODS adopted for SCD1, and includes a brief history of its development, of its testing with real data of foreign satellites, and of its assessment through the comparison of accuracies obtained. The third part, i.e. the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) performance, narrates the experience of the flight dynamics group on the fateful day of the launch: all the odds against the process of orbit determination in terms of lack of enough tracking data, failure of the launch vehicle staff in providing the injection information, last minute modifications of the      flight plan, and a few hours of anxiety which preceded the successful follow-up of the mission. The fourth part, i.e. the routine operations part, explains the methodology adopted for using the ODS in day-to-day operations, the accuracy in extended pass-predictions for the Brazilian tracking stations, and the overall performance of the ODS for SCD1. In addition, one also comments about the necessary modifications made during the routine operations along time and possible future improvements to be introduced in the software for the upcoming missions

The SCD1 was launched in its 25 degree inclination orbit at 750 km altitude on February 9th, 1993, by a Pegasus launch vehicle. This paper presents an evaluation of the in-orbit performance of the SCD1 satellite based on the analysis of its telemetry, which has been recorded since the first orbit. An analysis of the SCD1 performance in its first year of operation shows that the satellite design lifetime of one year can be extended by at least one year

   83:  In this paper an asymptotic Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) design procedure based on a modified version of the Parameter Robust Linear Quadratic Gaussian (PRLQG) approach is developed for designing a robust controller that accounts for unmodeled dynamics and parameter uncertainty for multi-input multi-output systems. The unmodeled dynamics are assumed to be characterized as a single block dynamic uncertainty at a point in the closed-loop system. Plant parameter variations are represented as an internal feedback loop via the input-output decomposition. A direct structural relationship between parameter uncertainties and the weighting matrices in the design of the LQG controller is exploited. This procedure is then applied to design a robust controller for attitude control and vibration suppression of the MB-1 Space Station configuration taking into account this mixed uncertainty model. This technique yields considerable improvement in robustness with respect to parameter variation without affecting the level of nominal performance and robustness with respect to unmodeled dynamics achieved during the design. Simulations have shown that when the system is submitted to unit impulse the controller was able to impose quick convergence      properties to the system

   83:  Nonlinear design procedures are presented for obtaining attitude and angular Momentum control laws for a rigid satellite. Besides the gravitational torque, a drag      torque is supposed to be applied to the satellite. By making use of physical and mathematical considerations, a Liapunov function is proposed that lends to a      asymptotically stable attitude control law. The problem of identifying some parameters related to the drag torque is also dealt by adding new terms to the proposed      Liapunov function. A mechanism for adjusting the parameters on line is obtained by forcing a condition in the time derivative of the modified Liapunov function that will imply stability for the whole system. Both types of controllers will be valid for large angular displacements and can be easily implemented, competing successfully with the usual algorithms based on linear control techniques

   83:  Remote sensing, meteorological and other types of satellites require an increasingly better Earth related positioning. From the past experience it is well known that the thermal horizon in the 15 micrometer band provides conditions of determining the local vertical at any time. This detection is done by horizon sensors which are accurate instruments for Earth referred attitude sensing and control whose performance is limited by systematic and random errors amounting about 0.5 deg. Using the computer programs OBLATE, SEASON, ELECTRO and MISALIGN, developed at INPE to simulate four distinct facets of conical scanning horizon  sensors, attitude errors are obtained for the Brazilian Remote Sensing Satellite (the first one, SSR-1, is scheduled to fly in 1996). These errors are due to the oblate shape of the Earth, seasonal and latitudinal variations of the 15 micrometer infrared radiation, electronic processing time delay and misalignment of sensor axis. The sensor related attitude errors are thus properly quantified in this work and will, together with other systematic errors (for instance, ambient temperature variation) take part in the pre-launch analysis of the Brazilian Remote Sensing Satellite, with respect to the horizon sensor performance

   83:  This paper presents the architecture and the concepts of the GAN (Antenna Manager Software) designed to execute pre-defined strategies to acquire the Brazilian satellite SCD1 on the horizon as well as to monitor and recover the satellite in any abnormal situation. Its primary objective is to allow ground station operators to track automatically the satellite from the beginning to the end of the satellite pass. Four acquisition strategies are available in order to cover all the situations. In addition GAN is able to command the antenna to perform uplink sweeps, to release telecommands and to record angular measurements. The flight dynamics aspects, performance, and results from the pre-launch test phase until the routine operation are presented. During the validation and test phase three different satellites (SPOT, ERS-1, and Hipparcos) served as benchmarks and were tracked. The prospect considering the re-usability of GAN for other mission types is presented at t

The CRC has the responsibility of operating in orbit the satellites developed by INPE or in cooperation with other organizations. This work presents an overview of the CRC system architecture, hardware and software, its operational structure and the activities undertaken in preparation of the whole system to support its first space mission. Relevant aspects of the CRC satellite operations activities, since its debut, on February 9, 1993 with the launch of the SCD-1 (Environmental Data Collecting Satellite), the first satellite designed, manufactured and operated in orbit by INPE, are briefly explained. Some parameters showing the present functional performance of the SCD-1 after a year in orbit are presented and discussed

   83:  This paper describes the main aspects of the attitude determination related to the first Brazilian satellite: the Data Collection Satellite (SCD1). The satellite was developed by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) as the first of the four scheduled by the program called Complete Brazilian Space Mission (MECB). It is spin-stabilized and was injected in a near-circular orbit, at an altitude of approximately 760 km. The attitude determination is achieved in two phases. In the first one, preliminary attitude is computed from sensors' telemetry data corresponding to passes over the tracking station. In the second one, data encompassing all the preliminary attitudes are processed to fit a dynamic model whose parameters are estimated. This paper aims at describing these procedures, their mathematical development and their evolution along time since the conception of the project. We also describe our first experience of a real satellite attitude determination, main difficulties, problems faced, as well as the solutions sketched at the very last minute. The results obtained are presented and discussed based on the expected performance of the software developed by the INPE's flight dynamics team

   83:  This paper describes the Brazilian Data Collection System set up into operational state after the SCD1 launch on 9 February 1993 into a low Earth orbit with inclination of 25 degrees and an altitude of 750 km. The system is composed of: Data Collection Platform (DCP) Networks where each DCP acquires the environmental data and transmits it to the SCD1 satellite in a predefined repetition rate; the SCD1 satellite with a message relay function; and the Ground Segment Infrastructure that acquires the payload data retransmitted by the satellite to the ground, processes and disseminates to the users, and that has the tracking and control functions to maintain the SCD1 in an operational state. After system operation during one year, some system performance issues are discussed. With the experience gained, future steps toward system evolution are presented. In spite of the experimental characteristics of the SCD1 satellite, the Data Collection System is working quite well. The analysis shows that the system concept used in the SCD1 as well as in the Ground Segment was reasonable

   83:  The analysis and control of a low-orbit Earth-satellite mission needs reliable and reasonably good data of satellite ephemerides. But various types of force model errors affect the low-altitude artificial satellite ephemerides generated by long-term orbit propagation procedures. Predominant among them are the errors in modeling the terrestrial gravitational force. Treating the geopotential model error, one of the aims of this work is to extend the equations of motion and the orbit error covariance function, derived for circular orbits previously, to elliptical orbits, and to propose a methodology to be adopted for estimating orbit errors in the case of elliptical orbit propagations. The whole theory and mathematical development for elliptical orbits is explained here in detail. Considering the model errors caused by incorrect truncation of gravity field, the other aim of this work is to extend the stochastic procedure, developed previously to evaluate the order of magnitude of the accumulated global error in short-term circular orbit propagations, to long-term circular orbit propagations. Here, the statistical estimates of uncertainties in orbital elements are obtained in terms of their covariances. After testing the theory developed with some simple examples, it is applied to a satellite with the orbital configuration similar to that of the first Brazilian satellite, launched on 9th February 1993. The results obtained here have been analyzed in detail in order to check the validity of the theory developed.

An area of 1 ha of virgin forest was cut in July 1995 and  left to dry until October of the same year. It was burnt using a procedure similar to that followed by native people in the region to prepare the land for cultivation. The  fresh biomass content in the test location, 684.8 t ha(-1), was determined using a formula with parameters from forest inventory. The dry biomass content was 401.5 t ha(-1).

   83:  Daily 500-hPa geopotential height and 250-hPa meridional wind reanalyzed data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction are used to document austral winter (May to September) and summer (November to March) high-frequency variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitudes for the 1990-1994 period. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) technique is used to determine the high-frequency patterns for these variables in selected areas. The high-frequency anomalous 500-hPa geopotential height patterns for two areas in the SH midlatitudes (the zonally global domain and the western hemisphere) and the high-frequency anomalous 250-hPa meridional wind patterns in the western hemisphere between 15 degrees N and 70 degrees S are discussed. The high-frequency winter and summer patterns for both variables feature a wavetrain structure in the SH midlatitudes which is related to synoptic-scale systems, such as cyclones and anticyclones associated with frontal zones. The dominant high-frequency patterns in the SH midlatitudes manifest in the eastern hemisphere while the secondary ones appear in the southeastern Pacific. Analysis of the western hemisphere data reveal that the wavetrain in the South American sector extends northeastward over the continent, thus affecting the regional weather conditions. An important result presented here concerns the preference of the intense synoptic systems in the eastern hemisphere and in the southeastern Pacific to occur in a sequential instead of an intermittent fashion. This result might have a potential for being used in weather monitoring

   83:  Many frost events over southeastern Brazil are accompanied by a large-amplitude upper trough of the middle latitudes that extends well into the Tropics. This paper first illustrates that a mechanism of downstream amplification across the Pacific into South America is generally accompanied in these situations. This is manifested by troughs and ridges that propagate eastward. An analysis of these situations during frost events shows that these features of downstream amplification, illustrated on a Hovmoller (x-t) pier, can be decomposed into a family of synoptic-scale waves that propagate eastward and a family of planetary-scale waves that acquire a quasi-stationary character during the freeze event. It is shown that a global model, at a resolution of 70 km, can be used to predict these features on the decomposition of scales during freeze events. It became apparent from these features that the growth of the long stationary waves during the freeze events may be due to scale interaction among wave components. This paper discusses the nature of these scale interactions, calculated from the energetics in the wavenumber domain, for periods before, during, and after the freeze events. The salient results are that nonlinear barotropic-scale interactions are an important source for the maintenance of the downstream amplification; however, the baroclinic (in scale) contributions dominate through the life cycle of the downstream amplitude where the large-amplitude troughs are indeed accompanied by baroclinic features. Finally, it is shown that a very high resolution regional spectral model can be used to handle the local aspects of the freeze events. This study offers the possibility for: designing prediction experiments on-the medium-range timescales for the forecast of these frost events

   83:  The evolution of the 30-60 day intraseasonal (Madden-Julian) oscillation (MJO), during boreal winter and summer, is studied by means of extended empirical orthogonal function analyses. For both seasons, the patterns describe an eastward traveling large-scale oscillatory regime with a period of approximately 45 days. Several atmospheric variables display a zonal wavenumber one pattern approximately symmetric about the equator. The seasonal variation of the MJO is investigated, especially in terms of the intraseasonal variability of the tropical convection. We find that the latitudinal location of the largest outgoing longwave radiation anomalies is directly related to the seasonal meridional shifts of the tropical convection in the Indo-Australian and Central American-South American regions. In the eastern hemisphere, the MJO affects the monsoons over India during boreal summer and over Australia during austral summer. In the western hemisphere the MJO has the greatest impact on convection over Northeast Brazil during austral summer and over Central America during boreal summer. The MJO-related evolution of 925-hPa specific humidity patterns (not previously documented) show remarkable seasonal dependence. The boreal summer patterns contain a large-scale component quite similar to that shown in the sea level pressure patterns. The austral summer patterns show strong regional variability that might indicate the interactions of the MJO with deep tropical convection in certain areas, such as along the South Pacific Convergence Zone and over northern South America

   83:  Studies to predict the impact of deforestation on climate in Amazonia have stimulated interest in the hydraulic properties of the soils of the region and the surrounding areas, Few directly measured hydraulic conductivity data are available; these were used to derive parameters to allow the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity-water content (K-theta) curve to be obtained from the more easily measured water retention curve, Relative hydraulic conductivity was modeled using the Brooks-Corey formula, whereas the saturated conductivity was calculated as a function of effective porosity from the expression proposed by Ahuja et al, Empirical relationships  were fitted to seven different Brazilian soils, from 13 different sites, assembling about 2650 field conductivity values, The data for six of the soil types could be represented by a single set of parameters, with kaolinitic yellow latosolic soils from Amazonia requiring a separate set, Fitted relationships showed very high  statistical significance, and the parameters derived were significantly different from those derived by Ahuja et al, for North American soils, To verify the proposed methodology, the parameters were derived using the complete data set (without the kaolinitic yellow latosol), excluding one soil type at a time, and checking the ability of the relationships to predict the conductivity of the soil not included in the fitting, In addition, the parameters obtained from the complete data set predicted hydraulic conductivities from the water release curves of five other Brazilian soils for which measured conductivity values were available

   83:  The application and validation of complex atmosphere-soil water transport models demands knowledge of the parameters that describe hydraulic properties over extensive areas. Such information is rarely available, but Pedo Transfer Functions (PTFs) provide a means of predicting these parameters from soil survey data, However, most PTFs have been derived and validated using information from soils of temperate regions and have nest been tested for the soils of tropical areas, for which chemical, physical, and pedogenetic processes are different. The equations of Rawls and colleagues, for example, overestimate water content when applied to the ails of Brazilian Amazonia. In this paper, we have developed a PTF to predict Brooks-Corey parameters from texture using data from soils of Amazonia.  Multiple linear regressions were fitted to estimate, from soil texture (
   83:   sand, silt, and clay), the bulk density and porosity and the water content at a range of matric potentials. Brooks-Corey parameters were then derived and correlated independently with soil texture, providing a straightforward method for deriving son retention parameters from the percentage of clay and silt. The method was validated using an independent data set for which textural and water release data were available, The agreement between the observed and measured values was very significant, but the results showed that the differences between predictions and measurements also depended on bulk density, However, the Amazonian soil survey  data, which may be used to extrapolate these results spatially, do not generally include bulk density, and for this reason they were not included in the regressions

   83:  Atmospheric general circulation models used for climate simulation and weather forecasting require the fluxes of radiation, heat, water vapor, and momentum across the land-atmosphere interlace to be specified. These fluxes are calculated by submodels called land surface parameterizations. Over the last 20 years, these parameterizations have evolved from sim pie, unrealistic schemes into credible representations of the global soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer system as advances in plant physiological and hydrological research, advances in satellite data interpretation, and the results of large-scale field experiments have been exploited. Some modem schemes incorporate biogeochemical and ecological knowledge and, when coupled with advanced climate and ocean models, will be capable of modeling the biological and physical responses of the Earth system to global change, for example, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide

   83:  The recent high deforestation rates in Amazonia have raised the question of how climate, mainly the precipitation patterns, might be affected as pasture land replaces the primary forest. This work initially shows how the dry season soil moisture and water stress in typical Amazonian pasture modifies the energy partitioning at the surface. Low-level moisture convergence is a primary mechanism to trigger convective cloud formation and precipitation. The relationship between moisture convergence and local surface evaporation in generating precipitation in Amazonia is studied utilizing a one-dimensional  'single column' model (SiB-1D). SiB-1D couples a surface-vegetation model (SiB) to a physical parametrization of deep convection (Kuo scheme), radiation, turbulent diffusion and large-scale precipitation. Model simulations for short periods (2 days) show its ability to calculate the Amazonian surface energy-balance components and boundary-layer dynamics when compared with field observations from the Rondonia Boundary-Layer Experiment and the Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study. The model was further used to test the sensitivity of the deep convection scheme to a range of typical low-level moisture convergence situations in a second experiment, and a third test investigated the local convective precipitation generated over forest and grass vegetation as a function of available soil moisture. Results showed that the rainfall over forest vegetation appeared to be almost insensitive to soil water stress whereas reduced precipitation was generated over pasture. When available soil water fell below a threshold of 60 percent the calculated precipitation over the pasture sites rapidly declined. Although these results are confined by the short integration period and the initial atmospheric profiles, they help to strengthen the notion that deforestation reduces evaporation and convective precipitation, especially during the dry season: a result already indicated by some previous general-circulation model experiments

   83:  Amazonian deforestation rates are used to determine human effects on the global carbon cycle(1-3) and to measure Brazil's progress in curbing forest impoverishment(1,4,5). But this widely used measure of tropical land use tells only part of the story. Here we present field surveys of wood mills and forest burning across Brazilian Amazonia which show that logging crews severely damage 10,000 to 15,000 km(2) yr(-1) of forest that are not included in deforestation mapping programmes. Moreover, we find that surface fires burn additional large areas of standing forest, the destruction of which is normally not documented. Forest impoverishment due to such fires may increase dramatically when severe droughts provoke forest leaf-shedding and greater flammability; our regional water-balance model indicates that an estimated 270,000 km(2) of forest became vulnerable to fire in the 1998 dry season. Overall, we find that present estimates of annual deforestation for Brazilian Amazonia capture less than half of the forest area that is impoverished each year, and even less during; years of severe drought. Both logging and fire increase forest vulnerability to future burning(6,7) and release forest carbon stocks to the atmosphere, potentially doubling net carbon emissions from regional land-use during severe El Nino episodes. If this forest impoverishment is to be controlled, then logging activities need to be restricted or replaced with low-impact timber  harvest techniques, and more effective strategies to prevent accidental forest fires need to be implemented

   83:  The authors investigate one case of surges of polar air that occasionally propagate into southeastern Brazil during wintertime and are harmful to coffee production because of the freezing conditions associated with them. The cooling is also observed in southern and, with less intensity, in western Amazonia. The event of 26 June 1994 is studied. The frost event caused a sharp drop in coffee production and similarly dramatic increases in coffee prices. The event was characterized by the presence of an anticyclonic perturbation off the coast of Chile that enters South America and crosses the Andes Mountains south of 45 degrees S hours later. The anticyclone center tracks equatorward until it reaches 20 degrees-30 degrees S and then shifts eastward toward the Atlantic. Based on a diagnostic analysis using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis, a two-stage process can be distinguished. In the starting period, midtropospheric troughing is established east of the Andes, over central Argentina, due to stretching and/or vorticity advection. This troughing is responsible for cold advection along the eastern flank of the Andes, which produces substantial temperature drops and deepens the upper trough locally. The increase in the magnitude of the zonal temperature gradients east of the cold advection zone at levels near 700 hPa is another result of the cooling process. This feature would ensure that the cold advection be extended eastward, producing an upper-level trough local deepening there. This intensification would produce an increase in the cyclonic Vorticity advection, which would tend to produce sea level pressure drops underneath. This near-surface low pressure area would eventually contribute to the southeastern Brazil (SE) cooling due  to the associated southerly winds.  Another feature is the near-surface local anticyclonic generation due to midtropospheric cold advection associated with descending motions, low-level divergence, and anticyclonic growth. Eventually this high pressure would also contribute to produce southwesterlies to transport cold air to SE. The paper is divided in two sections. The first part is a study of synoptic and climatic aspects of the cold surge episodes by using daily surface climatic observations. The purpose of the second part is to analyze the dynamic aspects of this cold episode and to study the cooling mechanisms by using the four-times-daily surface and upper-air NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, as well as to look for possible predictors

   83:  In order to investigate the dynamical behavior of the EEJ current system from its effects on ground based magnetic records, data from two low-latitude chains on the Brazilian sector was used. A quasi-simulated calculation method was developed to determine the current intensity distribution inside the EEJ. The resulting current distribution obtained using only the H component of the records reproduces quite well the observed temporal variations of the magnetic field. The analysis of the calculated current system shows that the EEJ in many cases has a double structure during the morning evolving into the classical "single structure" around noon when the effect of the EEJ is maximum

   83:  Southeastern Pacific blocking episodes are studied using 17 years of reanalyzed daily data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The anomalous sea level pressure (SLP) within the area bounded by the longitudes of 130 degrees W and 100 degrees W and the latitudes of 50 degrees S and 70 degrees S is used as the base variable to determine periods with 7 or more sequential days with positive anomalies in this domain. Using these periods, composites are calculated for the SLP and its anomalies, 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies and the 250-hPa and 925-hPa wind vectors in the western southern hemisphere (SH). Composites for austral winter and summer exhibit atmospheric circulation features quite similar to those associated with the blocking episodes in the southeastern Pacific. The corresponding composite patterns of the precipitable water (Pw) and 925-hPa temperature anomalies for the South American sector are also discussed. For both seasons blocking episodes in the southeastern Pacific change the distributions of these thermodynamic variables over South America, in particular in its southern and southeastern regions by reducing (increasing) the Pw and low-level temperature in the southern South America (the central part of the continent). Therefore, monitoring the southeastern Pacific circulation patterns may lead to improved weather forecast for The South American sector

The reviewed results of the optical parameter derivation were obtained during field radiation experiments carried out by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy os Sciences and Meteorology Observatory of Moscow State University in different Earth's regions and for different aerosol and cloud types. New results deal with the sensitivity of the solar broad band irradiance to the optical parameters of the aerosols os large biomass burning. The strong sensitivity of the solar radiation fluxes at the atmosphere boundaries and the heating rate inside the atmosphere to the aerosol optical thickness and the single scattering albedo is shown

   83:  Large-scale conversion of tropical forests into pastures or annual crops will likely lead to changes in the local microclimate of those regions. Larger diurnal fluctuations of surface temperature and humidity deficit, increased surface runoff during the dry season, and decreased soil moisture are to be expected. It is likely that evapotranspiration will be reduced because of less available radiative energy at the canopy levedl since grass presents a higher albedo than forests, and also due to reduces availability of soil moisture at the rooting zone primarily durein the dry season.  Coupled numerical models of the global atmosphere and biosphere have used recently to assess the effects of Amazonia deforestation on the regional and global climate. The results of these General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations show that, if the tropical forests were replaced by degraded grass (pasture) in the model, there was a significant increase in surface temperature and a decrease in evapotranspiration, precipitation and runoff. There was also  an increase in the lenght of the dry season which can have serious implications for the reestablishment of the tropical forests in the cleared areas. Global climate changes problaby will occur if there is a markeet chenge in rainfall patterns in tropical forest regions as a result of deforestation. It was also seen that tropical deforestation in Southeast Asia is less likely to cause largescale changes in precipitation of that region. On the other  hand, removal of Equatorial Africa's tropical forests might result in equatorward expansion of the semi-arid zones too the north and south of the rainforests

   83:  O inverno de 1995 nas Regi‰es Sul. Sudeste e Centro Oeste do Brasil foi at°pico, pois as temperaturas mÇdias mensais registradas neste per°odo apresentaram grandes desvios positivos e a precipitaá∆o ficou abaixo da mÇdia. Neste estudo foi feita uma an†lise dos campos atmosfÇricos, oceÉnicos e de superf°cie com o objetivo de se diagnosticar essas anomalias observadas. Nas anomalias de funá∆o de corrente em 200 hPa, foram identificados bloqueios na atmosfera que impediram a penetraá∆o de sistemas frontais pelo interior do continente. Foi tambÇm identificada uma configuraá∆o de " trem de ondas" com circulaá∆o anticiclìnicas sobre o Pac°fico sudeste e sobre a AmÇrica do Sul. Usando-se sÇries temporais de anomalias de Temperatura da Superf°cie do Mar (TSM) observou-se que as †reas 3 (no Oceano AtlÉntico Sul) e no 4 (no Oceano Pac°fico Sul) estiveram em oposiá∆o de  fases. A †rea 3 apresentou um cont°nuo resfriamento associado a uma circulaá∆o ciclìnica em baixos n°veis e a †rea 4 apresentou um aquecimento cont°nuo associado a uma circulaá∆o anticiclìnica subtropical. ABSTRACT The 1995 winter over south, southeast and central west Brazil was anomalous because montly mean temperatures recorded in this period showed large positive deviations and the precipitation was below normal. In th is study, atmospheric, oceanic and surface analyses were performed. The main goal is to diagnose the observed atmospheric anomalies over Brazil. Streamfunction anomalies at 200 hPa revealed the presence of a blocking atmospheric situation and a wavetrain configuration in July an August depicting and anticyclonic circulation over the Pacific Ocean and South America. The atmospheric pattern blocked the frontal system track which was displaced from the normal path crossing the interior of the continent to the coast region. Time series of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in areas 3 (over the South Atlantic Ocean) and 4 (over the South Pacific Ocean) were in opposite phase during the entire period. Area 3 showed a continuous cooling associated with a cyclonic circulation at low levels and area 4 showed a continuous warming associated with a subtropical anticyclonic circulation

ABSTRACT The purpose of this research is to carry out a comprehensive study on the seasonality of the water composition of a small catchment (164 ha) in NE Amazonia> The catchment area has an upper part with tropical undisturbed rainforest (34 ha) and the lower part (130 ha) has suffered some anthropic impacts. The results of one year sampling of reinfall, throughfall and stream water is analysed in the natural and in the altered areas, collected on a weekly basis. The temporal variability of the species concentration are evaluated along with a comparison of the anatural forested area waters with the altered one. The analysed species were: Na+, K+, Mg+, Ca˝+, NH4+, Cl-, NO¸- and SO4˝-. As expected, the input/output relationship of the species in the natural area shows a strong internal recycling component. The water chemistry varies slightly from month to month but that variation leads to a contrasting behavior of the water chemistry between the periods of high and low rainfall. During the wet season, some species, like Nitrate, are lost, but this is not yhe general trend for the analysed species. In the altered ares, the weathering is intense and almost all products of this process are being lost to the surfac e waters. The results indicate that this ecosystem can be particularly sensitive to disturbance during the period of high rainfall, due  to the high amount of chemical species being exported from the catchment and low nutrient storage capacity

   83:  We present 27 geodetic VLBI maps of OJ 287 obtained from the archive of the Washington correlator. The observations presented here were made between 1990 October and 1996 December. During this period a sequence of six superluminal
components has been identified. We measured the proper motion of these components to be approximately 0.5 mas yr(-1), which is about twice as high as that seen in previous VLBI observations. These results imply a higher component ejection rate than previously observed, in good agreement with the observed occurrences of radio outbursts. We have examined a possible connection between VLBI components and optical flares in the framework of a binary black hole system

We found strong quasi-periodic pulsating structures as the flux started to rise. Two significantly different time scales of similar to 2.5-4.5 s
and similar to 0.2-0.5 s have been observed. These pulsations might be related to magnetohydrodynamic perturbations in the active region. However the fast component also might be a signature of the acceleration and/or injection of energetic electrons

   83:  The multiple beam technique determine burst sources positions when their angular extent are small compared with the beam shapes. We show for the first time that we carl check the above condition with the simultaneous observation using at least four beams. The developed technique is not critically dependent on source shapes. By means of simulations me found that for narrow 1 arcmin long sources the uncertainties in position determination are less than 5 arcsec, and much better for symmetrical sources. The influence of side lobes on source positions determinations was found to be negligible. A qualitative method was developed when data from only three beams are available. Both methods are applied to the analysis of a solar burst observed with multiple beams at 48 GHz with the Itapetinga 13.7 m antenna. The multiple beam technique also offers the unique advantage to determine flux density irrespectively from the position displacements of the source with respect to the beams, or vice versa.

   83:  Fl Ninos and anti-El Ninos (La Ninas) are known to be associated with rainfall extremes in several parts of the globe. However, not all El Ninos show good associations. Recently, a finer classification of Fl Nino events was attempted. It was noticed that Unambiguous ENSOW (El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Warm) events (years when El Nino existed, and the Tahiti minus Darwin pressure difference (T - D) minima and equatorial eastern Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) maxima occurred in the middle of the calendar year) were very well associated with droughts in India and southeast Australia (Tasmania). In addition, C (cold SST, La Nina) events showed reverse effects (excess rains) in these regions. In the present paper, rainfall in selected regions in Central and South America are examined. For the Southern Oscillation Core Region (low latitudes, 155 degrees W-167 degrees E) and for the Gulf-Mexico region, no finer classification was necessary. All El Ninos were associated with excess rains and all La Ninas with droughts. As in India and Tasmania, Unambiguous ENSOW years were associated with droughts in some parts of northeast Brazil (Ceara, Rio grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco) and excess rains in Chile and Peru. C events did not have good associations except in Chile and Peru, where droughts occurred. The effect of El Ninos showed some dependence on the month of commencement. In years when El Ninos showed no effect, considerable influence of other factors (e.g. Atlantic SST on northeast Brazil rainfall) was noticed. Thus, predictions based on El Nino alone are likely to be erroneous, a fact which should be noted by the mass media. Effects of the recent Fl Nino of 1997-1998 are discussed

   83:  Langmuir turbulence plays an important role in electron heating and generation of plasma emission in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. The nonlinear dynamical behavior of Langmuir turbulence and its relevance in the interpretation of AGN variability is discussed. In particular, we study nonlinear saturation of the Langmuir stimulated modulational instability, for which the low-frequency mode is a resonant ion-acoustic wave. The nonlinear system of coupled wave equations is shown to undergo transition from order to chaos via the route of quasiperiodicity. The periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic variabilities in AGN emissions may be the electromagnetic signatures of the ordered and chaotic states of Langmuir turbulence in accretion disks or jets of AGN

It was completely developed at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) and is scheduled to be launched in 1992. The SCD 01 passive thermal control design   configuration is presented and the thermal analysis results are compared with the temperatures obtained from a Thermal Balance Test. The correlation between  the analytical and experimental results is considered very good. Numerical flight simulations show that the thermal control design can keep all the subsystem temperatures within their specified temperature range

Uma vers∆o mais atualizada desses modelos foi desenvolvida por Fliegel et al.,1992, onde por exemplo, foi inclu°da a radiaá∆o tÇrmica, as caracter°sticas ¢ticas das v†rias superf°cies do satÇlite, etc. Nesses modelos Ç assumido que os satÇlites s∆o mantidos orientados para o Sol, isto Ç, os painÇis solares permanecem normais ao plano que contÇm o Sol, a Terra e o satÇlite.Este trabalho mostra uma estratÇgia para avaliar o coeficiente de press∆o de radiaá∆o e faz uma aplicaá∆o do modelo ROCK42 para avaliar o efeito da press∆o de radiaá∆o solar sobre os satÇlites GPS

   83:  This paper focuses on the simultaneous structural/control optimization of a large space structure (LSS) subject to the gravity-gradient. The finite element method is used in conjunction with the Lagrangian formulation to derive the mathematical model for the structure. It is assumed to be a long unidimensional orbiting beam. In deriving the model vibrational and rotational planar motion and circular orbit are assumed. The NEWSUMT-A and the ORACLS computer programs are integrated to perform the simultaneous structural/control optimization problem. MATLAB software package is used for the transient phase simulation of the optimal integrated system. The simultaneous structural/control optimization is performed by the combined and the sequential integrated approaches (approach definitions are presented in this paper) with constraints on the structural weight, first natural frequency of vibration (bending), and on the damping (control). The results about the vibrational-rotational control for the optimal integrated system are presented through graphics. Comparison between those approaches shows some gains for the performance and control efforts for the sequential integrated approach

   83:  The optimal design of composite sandwich plates in which the facesheets are composed of a carbon fiber/epoxy net is considered. The objective of the work is to obtain minimum mass designs while maintaining constraints on the first natural frequency and selected facesheet stress components. The facesheets are assumed to be composed of an orthotropic net of unidirectional composite fiber strips and the  optimal design (the least mass design) is achieved by changing the strip widths and the spacings between them. It is demonstrated that varying the spatial fiber strip distribution can lead to significant structural advantages; in the example presented, a 32 percent  facesheet mass reduction is achieved

   83:  The finite analytic (FA) method, which has been recently developed and used in fluid flow and heat transfer problems, is presented and extended to the solution of the problem of transient heat conduction in a one-dimensional multilayered composite slab. The basic idea of the FA method is to incorporate a local analytic solution of the governing equation in the numerical solution of the boundary-value problem. In this study, the local analytic solutions are obtained by the standard integral-transformation technique and the associated eigenvalue problem is solved by the Galerkin method. Some numerical examples are computed to demonstrate the applicability of the FA method in dealing with heat diffusion in a composite material. It is shown that the FA method is accurate and provides reductions in computational costs

   83:  A tomographic reconstruction technique of a 3D internal distribution of defects, from an incomplete and noisy data set, is presented. The associated direct problem is solved numerically by the finite analytic method, using an alternating direction implicit  approach. A constrained optimisation algorithm together with a maximum entropy regularisation technique is used to solve the inverse problem. Numerical results, obtained from data sets simulated by the direct model and corrupted by Gaussian noise, demonstrate the good general performance of the proposed inversion method

   83:  This paper presents a Modification of Beard and James' Detection Filter for detecting and identifying faults in Linear Time Invariant Control Systems. This Modification permits an easier and more reliable identification of sensor faults. Even a single filter can identify faults in any independent sensor and in some actuators. Tests have been carried out to illustrate the filter performance and the way to adjust the filter  parameters. The test results demonstrate the validity of this Modification in detecting and identifying such faults

   83:  O sistema n∆o linear, de grande interesse pr†tico que Ç focalizado nesse trabalho Ç o mancal radial de deslizamento. Esse tipo de mancal consiste de um  rotor que gira dentro de um cilindro oco (anel Externo) de raio interno ligeiramente maior que o rio do rotor  com o espaáo entre eles sendo preenchido por um flu°do lubrificante. O sistema pode ser descrito por uma equaá∆o diferencial ordin†ria (edo) de Quarta ordem onde as foráas geradas pelo flu°do s∆o soluá‰es aproximadas de equaá‰es diferenciais parciais. Esse sistema revela um comportamento rico e complexo mesmo no caso mis simples (rotor perfeitamente balanceado, sistema autìnomo sem excitaá∆o). Rigorosos v°nculos geomÇtricos s∆o impostos sobre a excurs∆o do centro do rotor relativamente ao centro do anel externo no intuito de se evitar o contato entre ambos o que resulta na falha do sistema. Um dos objetivos do trabalho Ç investigar †reas potencialmente perigosas no espaáo de parÉmetros  que possam levar o rotor a atingir o anel externo. Essa pesquisa, portanto, fornece dados que garantem que a excurs∆o do rotor permanece est†vel ou numa ¢rbita fechada de extens∆o limitada. S∆o analisados mancais longos sobre a influància do mancal longo, o trabalho utiliza de mÇtodos numÇricos para problemas de bifurcaá∆o, para calcular pontos de bifurcaá∆o complexo  (ou de Hopf), e de mÇtodos numÇricos de continuaá∆o, para obter ramos de soluá‰es peri¢dicas que emanam de soluá‰es estacion†rias. S∆o mostradas, tambÇm, a amplitude e a freqÅància das soluá‰es peri¢dicas em funá∆o da velocidade angular do rotor para carregamentos leve, mÇdio e pesado.

   83:  ln this paper a generic model for a flexible space system consisting of an arbitrary numbers of flexible bodies connected to form a branched geometry is developed using a Lagrangian formulation. This approach is then applied to derive the equations of motion of the US Space Station first assembly flighty  configuration , referred as MB-1, taking into, account the coupled rigid body/flexible structural dynamic interaction. The matrices of admissible shape functions are used to represent the deformation due to flexibility of the MB-1 model. The equations of motion of the multibody system are written in matrix form, where particular attention is devoted to the development of the kinetic energy expression of rigid/flexible spacecraft model and deriving the inertia properties of the deformable structure that undergoes finite, rotations and small elastic deformations. In addition to the inertia matrix and conventional mass matrix that appear, respectively, in rigid body dynamics and the dynamics; of linear structural system, it is shown that a set: of Invariant submatrices that depend on the assumed displacement field bas to be evaluated in order to completely define, the mass matrix of the rigid/flexible spacecraft 1). These time-invariant matrices; appear in the components of the mass matrix and represent the coupling between the rigid and elastic body motion. As a result: of the Lagrangian approach the expressions for the system's  elastic potential energy due to its flexibility are also, derived. The frequency characterization of the MB-1 model is determined, solving the eigenvalue problem associated with the undamped uncontrollable case, and the potential problem for control structure interactions (CSI) is evaluated. The dynamic equations derived in physical coordinates are transformed into a set of decoupled equations In modal state space form. It is shown that this; procedure leads to computational advantages and facilitates to address issues such as model order reduction, truncation, and robustness with respect parameter variation and unmodelled dynamics in the context of the robust control design methodology, such as LTR/LQG, PRLQG and Hoo [2]

   83:  In this paper some aspects of the French-Brazilian Micro-Satellite attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) are presented. Basically, the mission is divided in two phase. In the first one, called aerobraking phase, the AOCS is responsible for the reduction of the orbit, in the second one, called routine phase, the, satellite must be pointing to the sum. The AOCS performance is evaluated when the satellite is subjected to environment perturbation torques during the routine phase mode. The requirements of pointing are necessary to perform the experiments of the French-Brazilian scientific mission

   83:  The use of high fidelity satellite simulators in the planning and preparation of space missions became a very usual practice. It allows one to set up in advance a realistic reproduction of the future operational environment of all mission phases, to aid in tasks such as development and validation of satellite operational procedures, mission application software validation and operation teams training. This work presents an overview of the main points of the simulator  modeling used for simulating the main dynamic variables involved in the process are discussed

   83:  The launch of the second INPE's environmental data collecting satellite, SCD2, is preliminarily scheduled for May 1998, by the American Pegasus launcher. This satellite is similar to the SCD2-A, whose launch, in November 2, 1997, by the Brazilian VLS launcher unfortunately, failed. When compared with the SCD1, the  SCD2 presents important differences related mainly to attitude stabilization and control. This paper presents an analysis of the main differences between both satellites and discusses their impacts on the flight dynamics system and related operations. For instance, the restriction on spin-axis attitude is, for the SCD2, more stringent than the ones imposed on the SCD1, requiring the application of a Quarter-Orbit Magnetic Attitude Control procedure (QOMAC). The spin-axis attitude control of SCD2 is detailed and its performance is analyzed with the help of available simulation results. Finally, the planning of the flight dynamics operations for the LEOP and routine phase of the SCD2 is described

   88:  spin stabilized satellite
   83:  The spin axis tilt due to asymmetries on a spin stabilized satellite equipped with long wire cable booms is evaluated. The problem is stated as a constrained optimization one, since  equilibrium state minimizes the kinetic energy under the angular momentum conservation law, besides the geometrical constraints of the booms. Three numerical procedures are presented to solve the non-linear optimum necessary condition: a direct iteration; a Newton-Raphson; and a predictor-corrector. Numerical results indicate that the first one works fine for the ordinary, slightly tilted case only. Convergence problems under arbitrarily high tilted conditions are properly dealt with the other two procedures.

   83:  In previous studies the authors applied parameter estimation procedures to satellite orbit and spin-axis attitude determination from GPS observables.This work adapts and applies those algorithms for the first time to real data from an experiment conducted at INPE in collaboration with UFPR. The experiment and the procedures are briefly presented and their numerical results shown. The attitude of a spinning bar with two offset antennas linked to independent receivers was determined from the  double-difference phase observable. The solution of the integer ambiguity problem takes advantage of the antenna baseline motion. The navigation solution is performed by ORBEST algorithm, which considers C-code pseudorange from all GPS satellites at sight. The work is a preliminary step towards the in flight Brazilian experiments foreseen for the near future

   83:  he SCD1, the First Brazilian spin stabilized Environmental Data Collecting Satellite, which was launched in February 1993, is still working fine. After four years since its launching, three years longer than the expected satellite lifetime, SCD1 still remains in a satisfactory operating state, very close to the nominal one. In this paper, an overall analysis covering the past four years of SCD1 orbit and attitude exploitation is presented. The experience of achieving software migration from the old DEC VAX-8350 computer system to a new DEC AXP 2100/M4-200 system, during satellite operation, is also described. The behaviour of the main satellite orbit and attitude parameters, since the beginning of the mission, is analyzed. The main problems and contingencies concerned to the Flight Dynamics operation, and its adopted solutions are described and discussed. Improvements to be considered in the flight dynamics software for the future INPE's similar satellites are commented.

   88:  attitude monitoring 
   83:  The first Brazilian satellite SCDI, designed and manufactured by the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE under the Complete Brazilian Space Mission (MECB) project, was launched on February 09, 1993 at 14:42:20 UTC by a Pegasus rocket of Orbital Sciences Corporation of USA. It is a spin-stabilized satellite and its thermal constraints prohibit the orientation of the spin-axis with respect to Sun's direction to rise above 90 degrees. Due to this condition, some type of spin-axis attitude monitoring was necessary during the useful lifetime of the satellite. Although various types of algorithms were developed for this purpose, unexpectedly, a software, which was developed during the satellite's mission analysis phase mainly in order to furnish the miss ion analysts with a fast, clear and integrated visualization of the preliminary attitude determination results and related aspects, was found useful for this purpose. For each orbit during a specified period, this software prepares and draws on a computer terminal, or optionally on a plotter, in inertial celestial sphere containing: the Sun's position; the Earth's shadow; the geomagnetic field vector trajectory; the satellite trajectory during its pass over a given ground station; and the attitude of the satellite spin-axis enveloped by its predicted uncertainty ellipse. A rational analysis of this map helps a mission analyst to select an optimum sub-set of satellite passes in order to achieve the best possible precision in the attitude determination process. However, besides fulfilling this main objective, after the SCD1 launch. the attitude determination software was found to be useful for various other purposes such as: the study of magnetometer bias fluctuations, observed from one pass of the satellite to other; an easy-monitoring of the spin-axis attitude etc. This software also helped the mission analysts to take some important decisions in improving the main attitude determination software. This paper narrates everything about the attitude follow-up software, starting from the initial idea based on which the software was developed till the developments along time and its final function. Being a debut of the attitude team of the flight mechanics group of INPE, the experience with SCDI related to attitude determination process gave challenging problems as well as pleasant surprises, some of which are from the attitude follow-up software. The main idea of this work is to share our first-hand experience with the first Brazilian satellite SCD I in the process of its attitude follow-up

   83:  The integration of two constellations of light and low-cost satellites, the Equatorial Communications (ECO) system and a polar orbit system for World Observation and Monitoring (WOM), is proposed. The WOM involves eight satellites and portable data reception and processing equipment. Onboard data compression enables UHF transmission of earth observation data. A system for global coverage with a temporal result of two passes per day is proposed. The ECO involves eight satellites in an equatorial constellation at 2000 mm. This system can supply low-orbit communications for equatorial countries and assist in the daily monitoring of ecologically protected areas

   83:  February 9, 1993 is the launch date of the low earth orbit, spin stabilized Data Collecting Satellite (SCD1), the first one designed, manufactured, and operated in orbit by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This paper gives an overview of the control operation activities and main difficulties found during the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) of the SCDI. A brief description is given about the INPE Ground Control System developed for controlling the SCD1 and succeeding satellites. The SCD1 satellite is described and the pre-launch activities are overviewed. Then, LEOP operations are presented with more details. It is shown that the main problems which were dealt with by the INPE satellite operation team occurred exclusively due to the Ground Control System shortcomings. The procedures adopted to overcome them, which assured the complete success of LEOP operations, are presented and discussed. Also discussed are relevant aspects concerning the execution of the satellite in-orbit acceptance tests

   83:  This paper describes the design, fabrication and testing of a hydrazine catalytic thruster with a vacuum thrust of 115 newton. The design guidelines and procedures are  presented and discussed. The thruster was tested over the range of feed pressure commonly used in blowdown systems with a ratio of 4:1; from 22 bar to 5.5 bar. The tests were conducted in atmospheric and altitude conditions. The measured thrust, chamber pressure and specific impulse were in good agreement with the design value. The mechanism responsible for the low frequency chamber pressure oscillations, observed during some test runs, is discussed

   83:  In this paper the problem of spacecraft orbit transfer with minimum fuel consumption is considered. The main goal is to study the effects of errors in the propulsive system in an orbit transfer problem. After a search in the literature and a analysis of the results available, we selected a method developed by Altman and Pistiner to be the base of the algorithm developed. The spacecraft is supposed to be in Keplerian motion controlled by the thrusts, that are assumed to be impulsive with errors in magnitude and direction. Results of simulations are also presented, to show the extra fuel and time required to complete the maneuver

   88:  transfer maneuvers
   83:  In this paper we studied statistically orbital maneuvers with  finite propulsion under thrust errors. We studied two transfer maneuvers: a) a high orbit low thrust coplanar transfer; and b) a middle orbit high thrust noncoplanar transfer, that is the first transfer of the satellite EUTELSAT II-F2. This transfer were realized with magnitude and direction ("pitch" and "yaw") errors in the thrust applied to the satellite. This errors were modeled as a stochastic process: random-bias and white or pink noise, with zero mean uniform probability function. We studied too the first moment (mathematical expectation) of the standard deviation of each thrust error. The general results suggest one simple nonlinear relation between the causes (in the initial instant) and effects (in the final instant), that one progressive deformation of the trajectory distribution along the propulsive arc was verified.

   83:  This work deals with the analytical sensitivity analysis procedure to implement the integrated structural and control optimization of a large low-Earth orbit space structure. The objective is to show that significant computation time can be saved when the analytical procedure is used instead of numerical calculation of the sensitivity. Despite the fact that the numerical approach is attractive because it does not require the hard algebraic task to develop the sensitivity derivative expressions, the approach is often responsible for the major computational cost of an optimization process. The analytical approach represents an attractive option when the computational effort becomes prohibitive under cost considerations

   87:  controle autìnomo de ¢rbita
   83:  0 excelente desempenho apresentado pelo sistema de rastreio francàs DORIS na miss∆o do satÇlite oceanogr†fico TOPEX/POSEIDON, bem como nos satÇlites de observaá∆o da terra SPOT2 e SPOT3 motivou o CNES ao desenvolvimento de um sistema autìnomo de determinaá∆o de ¢rbita, o qual foi denominado de DIODE - "Determination lmmediate d'Orbite Ö l'aide de measures Doris EmbarquÇes". Um modelo experimental deste sistema dever† ser integrado ao pr¢ximo satÇlite da sÇrie SPOT, o SPOT4, cujo lanáamento Ç previsto para 1998. 0 principal objetivo do sistema DIODE neste satÇlite Ç permitir o fornecimento em tempo real, aos usu†rios do satÇlite, das informaá‰es orbitais necess†rias ao processamento dos dados de imagens, atravÇs do envio dos dados orbitais conjuntamente com estes £ltimos.Contudo, a cont°nua disponibilidade a bordo de um conhecimento preciso da ¢rbita do satÇlite tomou atrativa a idÇia de desenvolver um sistema autìnomo de controle de ¢rbita para futuros satÇlites de baixa altitude semelhantes ao SPOT. Este trabalho apresenta um estudo de um sistema de controle autìnomo do desvio de fase no Equador (deriva em longitude) a partir de estimativas de ¢rbita geradas por um sistema autìnomo de determinaá∆o de ¢rbita do tipo do sistema DIODE. Tratam-se de estimativas em coordenadas cartesianas da ¢rbita osculadora do satÇlite, geradas Ö taxa de uma estimativa a cada dez segundos. Na sua vers∆o mais recente o sistema DIODE apresentou precis‰es da ordem de 3 m nas estimativas das componentes de posiá∆o e de 0.0 1 m/s nas estimativas das componente de velocidade.0 estudo do sistema de controle autìnomo de ¢rbita compreendeu os seguintes passos:a) Seleá∆o de um mÇtodo para o c†lculo da deriva em longitude no Equador e de sua derivada primeira em relaá∆o ao tempo, a partir de estimativas de ¢rbita similares Öquelas fomecidas pelo sistema DIODE. Tràs mÇtodos de c†lculo do desvio de fase no Equador foram analisados: utilizaá∆o de propagaá∆o de ¢rbita, a partir de cada estimativa gerada pelo sistema autìnomo de restituiá∆o de ¢rbita, de modo a determinar o instante e a longitude do pr¢ximo cruzamento com o plano equatorial; utilizaá∆o de relaá‰es de geometria esfÇrica para calcular o desvio de fase no Equador a partir do desvio de fase correspondente Ö longitude em que o satÇlite se encontra; utilizaá∆o das equaá‰es diferenciais que relacionam o desvio de fase no Equador aos parÉmetros orbitais 0 (ascená∆o reta do nodo descendente) e (argumento de latitude).b) Desenvolvimento e an†lise de um pre-processador para as estimativas autìnomas a serem utilizadas como dados de entrada para o controlador, de modo a executar processos de: validaá∆o, suavizaá∆o (pre-filtragem das componentes de curto per°odo dos dados de entrada, visto que as estimativas geradas pelo sistema DIODE s∆o estimativas da ¢rbita osculadora do satÇlite) e compress∆o (reduá∆o de redundÉncia ) dos dados  c)- An†lise de procedimentos de filtragem de Kalman e de m°nimos quadrados para estimaá∆o dos parÉmetros de um modelo parab¢lico de evoluá∆o no tempo do desvio de fase no Equador.d) Desenvolvimento e an†lise de procedimentos de controle do desvio de fase no Equador, tendo em vista os requisitos fundamentais exigidos Ö um sistema de controle autìnomo: baixa carga computacional e robustez. Dois tipos de procedimentos foram considerados. 0 primeiro considera a maximizaá∆o do intervalo de tempo entre a execuá∆o de duas manobras orbitais sucessivas. 0 segundo considera a aplicaá∆o de correá‰es de mesma amplitude sempre que necess†rio. Em uma vers∆o aprimorada deste tipo de procedimento a amplitude de correá∆o Ç escolhida de modo adaptativo Ös condiá‰es atmosfÇricas atuais.Os testes de desempenho foram executados com aux°lio de estimativas reais de ¢rbita dos satÇlites SPOT2 e SPOT3 (geradas por um prot¢tipo do sistema DIODE desenvolvido em PC), alÇm de estimativas simuladas das ¢rbitas destes satÇlites. Os principais resultados, conseguiram restringir a variaá∆o do desvio de fase no Equador a uma faixa da ordem de Ò200m, contra uma faixa de Ò3000m obtida com o controle de ¢rbita atualmente executado a partir do solo para os satÇlites SPOT, o que mostra viabilidade do conceito de controle autìnomo de ¢rbita estudado. Perspectivas de aplicaá∆o no contexto nacional s∆o avaliadas. Os autores agradecem Ö FAPESP, INPE e CNES pelo suporte fornecido por estas instituiá‰es Ö realizaá∆o da pesquisa

   83:  The objective of this paper is to study the station keeping maneuvers that will have to be performed by the CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) satellite. The CBERS is a remote sensing satellite that is under development by China and Brazil. This satellite is planned to stay in a polar frozen orbit and station keeping maneuvers will have to be performed to keep its orbital elements in a specified range. This paper is devoted to study the correction of the semi-major axis, eccentricity and argument of periapse, that are three of the Keplerian elements that will change due to the orbit perturbations. An algorithm capable of calculating the bi-impulsive transfer orbit with minimum AV between any two Keplerian and coplanar orbits is developed and used to calculate the maneuvers expected for the CBERS satellite. Several maneuvers are simulated, both to change the orbital elements individually or in groups. This algorithm is based on the minimum AV Lambert's problem shown in Prado, (1993) and Prado  Broucke (1994). In the format that it is implemented here it is possible to include constraints in the region of the orbit that an impulse can be applied. The advantage of this approach is that there is no approximation or linearization involved, and, in consequence, the method derived can be used to transfers of any magnitude

   83:     Um corpo vindo de fora da esfera de influància de um corpo celeste pode ter sua velocidade relativa a este corpo diminu°da devido a fenìmenos exclusivamente gravitacionais. Ele pode atÇ orbitar este corpo por algum tempo. Este fenìmeno Ç conhecido como captura gravitacional e Ç de natureza transit¢ria. PorÇm, um ve°culo espacial em trajet¢ria de transferància entre dois corpos celestes, utilizando seus propulsores, pode aproveitar este momento para completar uma captura permanente, ganhando com isto uma reduá∆o de consumo de combust°vel (Yatnakawa et affi, 1992).Este fenìmeno Ç encontrado no problema restrito de tràs corpos, e pode ser estudado atravÇs do monitoramento da energia total de dois corpos. Esta energia Ç constante no problema de dois corpos, mas quando se utiliza o modelo de tràs (ou mais) corpos e se analisa a energia do ve°culo espacial em relaá∆o ao corpo em que se deseja a captura, isto deixa de ser verdadeiro, e ent∆o Ç poss°vel uma transiá∆o de uma ¢rbita hiperb¢lica (aberta) de energia positiva, para uma ¢rbita el°ptica (fechada) de energia negativa.Existem v†rios parÉmetros importantes para serem estudados neste fenìmeno, como por exemplo: o modo em que os dois corpos celestes est∆o em ¢rbita um do outro (¢rbita circular ou ¢rbita el°ptica) (Viera Neto e Prado, 1996); o tempo necess†rio para ocorrer a captura (Vieira Neto e Prado, 1995), etc.. Neste trabalho ser† dado ànfase ao efeito do parÉmetro gravitacional  que relaciona a massa dos dois corpos celestes. A importÉncia deste parÉmetro se deve ao fato da possibilidade da generalizaá∆o desse estudo para sistemas diferentes do Terra-Lua, com isto pode-se estudar como o fenìmeno de captura gravitacional varia com o parÉmetro gravitacional e pode-se entender em quais tipos de transferàncias existir† um maior ganho (menor consumo de combust°vel). Uma utilizaá∆o direta disto, Ç a comparaá∆o de uma captura bal°stica no sistema Terra-Lua com uma no sistema Sol-J£piter

   83:  0 uso de sensores estelares para determinaá∆o precisa da atitude de satÇlites artificiais requer um procedimento sistem†tico de identificaá∆o das estrelas observadas. S¢ assim Ç poss°vel associar corretamente as coordenadas instrumentais de cada observaá∆o realizada pelo sensor com suas respectivas coordenadas catalogadas em um dado referencial inercial. 0 processo de identificaá∆o em si pode ser autìnomo ou assistido por sensores n∆o estelares que fornecem uma aproximaá∆o grosseira a priori da atitude do satÇlite. Esta £ltima modalidade, por sua relativa simplicidade, vem sendo estudada numa primeira etapa do projeto de desenvolvimento de um sensor estelar no INPE. Trata-se de um rastreador de estrelas de matriz CCD com campo de visada de 10ß x 10ß e capaz de rastrear atÇ cinco estrelas de atÇ quinta magnitude simultaneamente. Neste contexto um procedimento de identificaá∆o de estrelas pelo mÇtodo de comparaá∆o direta foi testado via simulaá∆o digital. Segundo o referido mÇtodo, primeiramente as coordenadas instrumentais de cada estrela s∆o transformadas para o referencial inercial atravÇs da matriz de atitude a priori. Em seguida, dentro de um raio de busca centrado nas coordenadas assim obtidas, selecionam-se estrelas candidatas no cat†logo. Devido a imprecis‰es deste e do sensor, mas principalmente da atitude a priori, quatro possibilidades se apresentam: identificaá∆o errìnea, onde uma £nica estrela candidata Ç selecionada, n∆o sendo porÇm a estrela correta; n∆o identificaá∆o, onde nenhuma estrela candidata Ç selecionada; identificaá∆o correta, onde apenas a estrela correta Ç selecionada; e identificaá∆o amb°gua, onde mais de uma estrela candidata Ç selecionada. 0 raio de busca, do qual depende a eficiància do mÇtodo, deve idealmente maximizar a probabilidade de identificaá∆o correta e minimizar as demais, especialmente a de identificaá∆o errìnea. 0 mÇtodo de otimizaá∆o com m£ltiplos critÇrios foi empregado para atingir estes objetivos simultaneamente. Uma vez identificadas as estrelas, a atitude em 3 eixos Ç estimada por um mÇtodo de m°nimos quadrados. Estat°sticas dos resultados demonstram o desempenho do procedimento em funá∆o das vari†veis em quest∆o

   83:  Neste trabalho Ç feita uma an†lise  modal experimental, a partir de um prot¢tipo de uma estrutura flex°vel multicorpos, montado nos laborat¢rios de dinÉmica  do ITA-IEW com a finalidade de se investigar o comportamento dinÉmico desta estrutura. A montagem desses experimento, tem por objetivo assemelha-lo ao m†ximo Ö estrutura de um satÇlite, Contendo apàndices flex°veis visando a aplicaá∆o dos resultados deste trabalho Ö †rea aeroespacial. 0 experimento faz parte do projeto "EstrFlex" o qual Ç financiado pelo CNPq e vem sendo desenvolvido atravÇs de uma cooperaá∆o entre WE-ITA. A montagem (Figura 1) Ç composta de duas vigas flex°veis, engastadas a um cubo, o qual se encontra acoplado a um disco que repousa sobre um colch∆o de ar (apoiado em um mancal a g†s ax°al) na tentativa de se minimizar o atrito est†tico, permitir lima maior mobilidade Ö estrutura e simular um ambiente no qual a aceleraá∆o da gravidade Ç zero (ambiente espacial). 0 disco se encontra ligado a um motor DC, que fornece a excitaá∆o necess†ria Ö estrutura. Devido Ö pel°cula de ar existente entre o disco e a estrutura a qual este est† apoiado, a ligaá∆o entre o disco e o motor, Ç feita por um acoplamento flex°vel confeccionado em alum°nio (para minimizar a inÇrcia) que permite um pequeno movimento vertical ao eixo do motor. A instrumentaá∆o deste experimento Ç composta de dois acelerìmetros; piezelÇtricos, posicionados nas respectivas extremidades das vigas flex°veis, que possuem uma massa pequena em relaá∆o Ö massa da viga, para que seu peso n∆o influencie na dinÉmica do sistema; de dois extensìmetros posicionados em locais conhecidos nas vigas, um tacìmetro cujo sinal Ç gerado pelo motor que fornece a velocidade angular do eixo ao qual o motor seu acoplado e um potenciìmetro solid†rio ao cubo que fornece a posiá∆o angular deste mesmo eixo. Utilizou-se um Analisador DinÉmico de Sinal (HP-3WSA) com dois canais para aquisiá∆o dos dados fornecidos pelos sensores e pelo atuador. Este analisador calcula a funá∆o resposta em freqÅància, entre Ö excitaá∆o gerada e o sensor que estiver ligado a um dos canais de aquisiá∆o de dados. Ap¢s a montagem do experimento, a identificaá∆o da planta foi feita atravÇs da comparaá∆o de resultados obtidos fazendo-se unia an†lise modal experimental na estrutura e resultados anal°ticos, obtidos, com a modelagem da planta

   83:  This paper focuses on the simultaneous approach for structural/control optimization of a Large Space Structures with articulations, subject to the gravity-gradient. The finite element method has been used in conjunction with the Lagrangian formulation to derive the attitude dynamic equations of motion. The attitude is constrained to the orbital plane (pitch) and the orbit is assumed to be circular. The optimization problem formulation consists of defining a composed function given by the structural objective function plus the classic control cost c on associate to Linear Quadratic Regulator problem. The integrated approach links the structural and the control optimization together through the common constraints imposed on the system. The constraints taken into account for this study were placed on the structural weight, the first natural frequency of free vibration and on the control damping. The Search for Unconstrained Minimization Techniques, SUMT, were used to solve the optimization problem for the structure. By this approach the constrained problem is transformed into a sequence of unconstrained problems. The problem were solved by using the NEWSUMT-A and the ORACLS software package. The main features of the NEWSUMT-A includes: a) Newton's method with approximate second derivatives, used in the direction finding part of the unconstrained minimization; b) an extended interior penalty function formulation, used for inequality constraints; c) equality constraints are handled using exterior penalty functions; d) constraint approximations with an optional move-limit strategy. The MatLab software package has been also used to simulate the transient phase considering the optimal integrated system obtained by the integrated structure and control optimization. The control concept here consists of keeping the attitude close to a nominal configuration and of damping elastic vibrations. The paper facuses also: on the sensitivity analysis of the control system to small modifications in the structural parameters, and; b) on the software integration problems to solve the integrated structural and control optimization. The main steps involved in the integrated optimization process are: a) for given values of the cross sectional areas of the elements the eigenvalue problem is solved to yield the frequencies of free vibration and its associated eigenvectors; b) the plant matrix and the input matrix in the state-space input equations are calculated; c) the linear optimum regulator control problem is solved and the closed-loop eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and damping factors are determined by using the ORACLS package; d) the NEWSUMT-A optimizer generates a new set of design variables; and e) with these new design variables steps a-e are repeated until the optimum solution satisfying all the specified constraints is obtained

   83:  A quest∆o que intitula o trabalho surge diante da tremenda potencialidade das manobras gravitacionalmente assistidas (usualmente denominadas "swing-by") em aumentar a energia orbital. A possibilidade do uso inteligente da influància do campo gravitacional de um astro para redirecionar intencionalmente a ¢rbita de satÇlites artificais j† foi largamente estudada e inclusive comprovada por v†rias miss‰es terrestres e interplanet†rias. Com efeito, miss‰es que de outra forma seriam inviabilizadas na pr†tica pelo eleva do consumo de combust°vel requerido foram bem sucedidas graáas a tais manobras em tomo dos planetas, bem como da Lua. Neste trabalho, explora-se especificamente a quest∆o da existància de uma velocidade m†xima de escape do (e a quest∆o dual quanto a uma velocidade m†xima de captura pelo) sistema solar, ating°vel por uma sÇrie de manobras computacionalmente assistidas em tomo dos planetas. A quest∆o Ç apenas introduzida com uma abordagem o mais simplificada poss°vel, no intuito de estabelecer as condiá‰es que qualitativamente determinem a existància deste limite. Assim, o swing-by foi modela do como dois problemas desacoplados de trajet¢rias em campo Newtoniano, sendo o Sol o respons†vel pelo campo na macro escala da ¢rbita e o planeta na micro escala em sua pr¢pria vizinhanáa. Os planetas foram via de regra supostos presentes na posiá∆o necess†ria para a realizaá∆o de swing-by rasante Ö sua superficie. Restriá‰es quanto Ö viabilidade desta simplificaá∆o foram impostas apenas ao caso de ¢rbitas hiperb¢licas e com sucessivos swing-bys sobre o mesmo planeta. Em princ°pio, cada swing-by pode ocorrer com o satÇlite em ¢rbita direta ou retr¢grada; com velocidade radial positiva ou negativa; e atingindo o ponto de cruzamento entre suas respectivas ¢rbitas antes ou depois do planeta, perfazendo um total de oito possibilidades. Um mapeamento nos parÉmetros energia e momento angular permite esquematizar o efeito conjugado de m£ltiplos swing-bys nos planetas de influància mais significativa. Com isto pretende-se abrir a quest∆o para posteriores an†lises quantitativas mais realistas

   83:  Em anos recentes, as redes neurais artificiais vàm encontrando diversos campos de atuaá∆o dentro da atividade humana e, progressivamente, tàm-se encontrado novas aplicaá‰es. 0 principal motivo desse novo interesse deveu-se, principalmente, ao desenvolvimento de novas express‰es que permitiram o aprendizado de rede multi-camadas, com a adoá∆o de mÇtodos como a retro-propagaá∆o (back-propagation) e o j† tradicional m°nimos quadrados. AlÇm disso ficou provado que redes neurais de apenas duas camadas podem aproximar com uma acuidade prÇ-estabelecida qualquer funá∆o n∆o-linear cont°nua e limitada. Foi reconhecida a propriedade de representaá∆o de funá‰es n∆o-lineares complexas por redes do tipo perceptron de v†rias camadas, e pelas redes realimentadas, de Hopfield. A principal vantagem das redes deve-se sobretudo Ö sua capacidade de aprendizagem, o que elimina a necessidade de modelos matem†ticos sofisticados na resoluá∆o do problema. Alia-se tambÇm a possibilidade de processamento paralelo e a relativa tolerÉncia das redes Ö falha de alguns poucos neurìnios, sem que com isso seja comprometido seu desempenho, principalmente em sistemas com elevado n£mero de neurìnios. As redes apresentam, quando utilizadas em controle de sistemas, a versatilidade de lidar com grandes quantidades de informaá‰es provindas de elementos sensoriais. Pela formulaá∆o cl†ssica, Ç muito dif°cil para um controlador absorver eficientemente e fazer uso de informaá‰es oriundas de diversos sensores, pois precisa de modelos que associem os sinais dos sensores com as vari†veis de estado. Em contrapartida, a pr¢pria arquitetura paralela das redes facilita seu emprego onde essa gama de informaá‰es provindas de sensores Ç necess†ria. Em resumo, uma rede neural artificial apresenta como caracter°sticas principais a faculdade de aprendizagem ou adaptaá∆o, a possibilidade de processamento paralelo, e a capacidade de manipulaá∆o de grande quantidade de informaá‰es. 0 presente trabalho visa analisar e viabilizar controladores de atitude de satÇlites baseados em redes neurais. 0 controlador utilizado aqui usa uma rede neural para modelar o sistema dinÉmico (movimento em atitude do satÇlite) e uma segunda rede para realizar o controle. Como exemplo da implementaá∆o, optou-se por realizar uma simulaá∆o utilizando as caracter°sticas do satÇlite de sensoriamento remoto (SSR) da MECB. Para validar o controle e diferenci†-lo das implementaá‰es tradicionais, baseadas em linearizaá‰es da dinÉmica nas regi‰es pr¢ximas Ö referància (ou do ponto de equil°brio), considerou-se o caso at°pico do instante de abertura dos painÇis solares, onde grandes alteraá‰es na dinÉmica da planta ocorrem rapidamente. Os principais mÇtodos de controle baseados em redes neurais ser∆o apresentados, com ànfase no modelo IMC ( Internal Model Contro), que ser† empregado na simulaá∆o

   83:  SatÇlites artificiais com requisitos de alta precis∆o de determinaá∆o de atitude inevitavelmente contam com sensores estelares. As tecnologias de microprocessadores e de matrizes CCD tomaram poss°vel a construá∆o de rastreadores estelares capazes de realizar determinaá∆o autìnoma de atitude em tràs eixos a bordo (Bank, 1995), o que contempla potencialmente uma ampla variedade de satÇlites em miss‰es cient°ficas e de observaá∆o terrestre, alÇm de sondas interplanet†rias. A utilizaá∆o deste tipo peculiar de sensor de atitude, contudo, requer 3 m¢dulos b†sicos: o hardware propriamente dito (incluindo ¢tica e eletrìnica do sensor); software de identificaá∆o autìnoma de estrelas (incluindo o software de varredura e rastreio do sensor e o cat†logo de estrelas embarcado); e o software de determinaá∆o de atitude, que pode ou n∆o incluir a calibraá∆o do sensor. Diante disso, e tendo em vistas o atual projeto de desenvolvimento de um sensor estelar no INPE, o presente trabalho estuda os aspectos envolvidos na elaboraá∆o de cat†logos estelares dedicados a tais miss‰es. Suas caracter°sticas essenciais s∆o estabelecidas com base nos requisitos de determinaá∆o autìnoma de atitude. Assim, alÇm das coordenadas e magnitudes das estrelas guias, a separaá∆o angular entre cada par de estrelas deve ser catalogada ordenadamente formando uma base de dados adequada para a identificaá∆o autìnoma das estrelas. A seleá∆o das estrelas guias obedece a critÇrios estat°sticos de uniformidade global (Vedder, 1993) e identificabilidade local. Numa primeira etapa ser∆o realizadas simulaá‰es com base em estrelas de atÇ quinta magnitude. Posteriormente, o procedimento ser† testado em cat†logos artificialmente ampliados com pseudo- estrelas simuladas pelo conceito de representaá∆o fractal, preservando caracter°sticas estat°sticas previamente estabelecidas quanto a distribuiá∆o espacial, movimento pr¢prio, magnitude e estabilidade de brilho das estrelas. Uma vez identificadas as estrelas, a atitude ser† estimada pelo algoritmo QUEST (Shuster  Oh,1981)

   83:  Neste trabalho ser† feita uma implementaá∆o de um mÇtodo de otimizaá∆o de trajet¢rias movidas a baixo empuxo sem erro nos propulsores e v†lidas para ¢rbitas Keplerianas. A partir desse mÇtodo, pretende-se desenvolver um novo mÇtodo que determine a lei de controle, levando em conta os erros dos propulsores, tanto em magnitude como em direá∆o. Ser† dada uma abordagem probabil°stica Ös incertezas do problema como, por exemplo: uma distribuiá∆o estat°stica dos empuxos causados pela massa dos gases dos propulsores, da geometria da montagem destes, da variaá∆o do centro de massa do ve°culo, etc. AlÇm disso, pode-se experimentar esse mÇtodo para ¢rbitas n∆o-Keplerianas em diversas situaá‰es: com arrasto atmosfÇrico bastante pronunciado; com efeitos do potencial perturbador da n∆o-esfÇricidade da Terra; com perturbaá∆o de terceiro corpo, etc...Como resultado final, teremos um estudo completo de uma transferància entre duas ¢rbitas n∆o-coplanares, movidas com um empuxo cont°nuo, levando em conta perturbaá‰es na dinÉmica e n∆o-idealidades dos propulsores

   83:  Este artigo trata do controle de atitude do Primeiro Satelite Brasileiro de Aplicaá∆o  Cient°fica (SACI-1). Trata-se de um satÇlite pequeno, 60 kg, previsto para ser lanáado em 1.997, pelo lanáador chinàs Longa Marcha 4. A ¢rbita ser† polar a 750 Km de altitude. O sistema de controle de atitude (SCA) combina controle passivo via estabilizaá∆o por rotaá∆o, com controle ativo via controle geomagnÇtico. 0 satÇlite ser† lanáado como carga secund†ria. 0 £ltimo est†gio do lanáador ser† estabilizado em tràs eixos ap¢s uma manobra de apontamento de seu eixo axial para a Terra. 0 satÇlite principal, CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite), ser† ent∆o injetado com uma de suas faces direcionadas para a Terra, tambÇm estabilizado em tràs eixos. 13 segundos ap¢s a injeá∆o do CBERS o SACI-1 ser† injetado com uma atitude semelhante a Ö satÇlite principal. Por esta raz∆o SCA do SACI-1 dever† executar as tarefas de: a) rotacionamento (spin up); b) captura do Sol; c) manutená∆o da atitude e da velocidade de rotaá∆o do satÇlite dentro dos valores nominais especificado.

   83:  The Brazilian Scientific Applications Satellite (SACI-1) structure, was devised as a multipurpose bus for scientific and commercial applications (see figure below). The Structure Subsystem is divided. into two substructures: the Mainbody (Payload and Platform), and the adapter. Its overall shape resembles a parallelepiped measuring 600 x 400 x 400 mm (Mainbody only) and weighting less than 65 kg (Mainbody plus Adapter).The Platform consists, on a pack of  9 ribbed frames of different thickness stacked horizontally and connected by means of 12 studs. Each module holds one or two printed circuit boards belonging to the bus or the payload. The Payload is assembled on the top of the Platform and has six ribbed plates that form a box in which most of the payload is assembled. Opening windows are provided on demand. All parts of the Platform and Payload are made from 6061 T 651 aluminum alloy plate or rod machined to their final shapes. Finally there is an Adapter that provides all the hardware necessary to assemble the satellite to the launcher and separate it when in orbit. The separation is accomplished by cutting on central pin that joins the Platform to the Adapter. Another function of the Structure Subsystem is to provide the appropriate mounting surfaces to integrate parts located on the outer surface of the structure, like the SACI-1 satellite mechanisms of the deployable panels (hinges, snubbers and restrain and release mechanism), balancing masses, antenna sand solar sensors. The analyses of this structure was done using the MSC/NASTRAN Finite Element Method code. The finite element model has, 12 spring elements, 4236 plane elements, 1696 bar elements and 5974 grid points. This model was used for static, normal modes, frequency response, transient response and random vibration analyses, according to the loads provided by the launching agency. The main objectives of this model are: (a) to verify the preliminary design of the structure, and provide the necessary changes; (b) to determine the first global frequencies of the assembly and; (c) to verify the acceleration on the printed circuit boards. This work describes how this structure as designed and analyzed in order to fulfil all the requirements of the mission

   83:  Este trabalho tem como objetivo realizar alguns dos estudos que ainda necessitam ser efetuados referentes ao problema de manobras orbitais com o satÇlite CBERS. Foi obtida a soluá∆o do problema de transferància em ve°culo espacial entre duas ¢rbitas n∆o coplanares dadas, atravÇs da aplicaá∆o de dois impulsos, com consumo  de combust°vel em uma dinÉmica kepleriana. Para isto desenvolveu-se um mÇtodo de c†lculo e um software que utiliza equaá‰es anal°ticas para as componentes do impulso aplicado.Esse mÇtodo de c†lculo foi dividido em duas etapas distintas. Em uma primeira etapa foi considerado que as £nicas foráas envolvidas na dinÉmica do sistema s∆o as foráas dos propulsores (instantÉneas) e a foráa gravitacional da Terra (assumida como um ponto de massa). 0 problema resume-se a obter uma ¢rbita kepleriana de transferància entre duas outras ¢rbitas keplerianas n∆o coplanares conhecidas previamente. Essa manobra deve ser efetuada de tal forma que a soma das magnitudes dos dois impulsos aplicados seja m°nima.  Ap¢s essa primeira etapa, pretende-se buscar um mÇtodo de soluá∆o para o problema n∆o kepleriano baseado no Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). Ser† assumido que a dinÉmica do sistema inclui foráas perturbadoras, tais como arrasto atmosfÇrico, atraá∆o Iuni-solar, entre outras. A soluá∆o obtida pelo mÇtodo anterior (com modelo kepleriano) ser† utilizada como estimativa inicial

   88:  SatÇlite Cient°fico de Coletas de Dados
   88:  SCD1
   83:  0 satÇlite de coleta de dados ambientais (SCD1), primeiro satÇlite, brasileiro projetado e confeccionado no instituto Nacional de Pesquisa Espaciais (INPE), foi lanáado em Fevereiro de 1993 por um lanáador americano, n∆o inteiramente qualificado na Çpoca, denominado Pegasus, o qual utiliza um conceito inovador, sendo lanáado a partir de um avi∆o B-52. 0 SCD1 tem objetivo de receber, em UHF, aos dados emitidos automaticamente por plataformas de coleta de dados (PCD's), transpor em tempo real este sinal para a banda S e emiti-lo de volta ao solo. Quando o satÇlite se encontra em visibilidade m£tua a estaá∆o de rastreio de Cuiab† e a uma ou mais PCD's a estaá∆o de rastreio recebe os dados desta PCD. Os dados das PCD's dispon°veis, distribu°das por pontos estratÇgicos do territ¢rio brasileiro, s∆o transmitidos ao Centro de Miss∆o de Coleta de Dados, em Cachoeira Paulista onde s∆o processados e distribu°dos aos usu†rios finais. Atualmente existe da ordem 28 PCD's ativas das quais 13 comp‰em a rede do programa Amazona para ciàncias ambientais e destinam-se a estudos da camada de Ozìnio e de incàndios florestais atravÇs de medidas da variaá∆o da concentraá∆o no ar de CO, CO e 0 , e a estudos de regeneraá∆o da floresta tropical atravÇs da monitoraá∆o em tràs locais diferentes (deflorestado, floresta nova e floresta velha) de parÉmetros que permitem o estudo da taxa de reflorestamento; 7 s∆o dedicadas ao estudo de marÇs e as 9 restantes medem parÉmetros meteorol¢gico sendo que, destas, 7 pertencem Ö Fundaá∆o Cearense de Meteorologia e Recurso H°dricos (FUNCEME) e medem parÉmetros meteorol¢gicos. 0 SCD1 pode opera simultaneamente com atÇ 500 PCD's. A rede de PCD's est† em fase de expans∆o com um incremento de 10 DCP's a serem instaladas em Santa Catarina , Mina Gerais, Cear† e Cachoeira Paulista e outras 250 a serem instaladas pelo Departamento Nacional de µgua e Energia ElÇtrica (DNAEE) para aplicaá‰es hidrometeorol¢gicas e ambientais. 0 satÇlite SCD1 Ç um satÇlite de baixa altitude (-750 km) com inclinac∆o orbital de 25 graus e estabilizado passivamente em atitude por rotaá∆o (120 rpm no lanáamento). 0 satÇlite te 115 kg e possui o formato de um prisma octogonal. Todas as suas faces s∆o revestidas por cÇlulas solares exceto a face inferior usada para dissipaá∆o tÇrmica. Por este motivo a incidància de luz solar direta neste painel provocaria um aquecimento excessivo dos equipamentos do satÇlite danificando-os. Para evitar esta situaá∆o o satÇlite apresenta-se munido de uma bobina magnÇtica que quando acionada interage com o campo geomagnÇtico gerando um torque que provoca a variaá∆o da orientaá∆o do eixo de rotaá∆o do satÇlite satÇlite. Isto permite a execuá∆o de manobras para controle do valor d Éngulo de aspecto solar evitando-se que este ultrapasse 90 graus, condiá∆o de in°cio de incidància do Sol na face inferior do satÇlite. 0 Subsistema de Controle de Atitude do satÇlite disp‰e ainda de um amortecedor de nutaá∆o, um magnetìmetro de tràs eixos e dois sensores solares digitais. As medida destes sensores s∆o transmitidas ao solo por telemetria onde s∆o utilizada para a determinaá∆o da atitude do satÇlite

   83:  Num trabalho recente Gonáalves e Machado (1995) propuseram um mÇtodo computacional para obter diagramas de bifurcaá‰es para sistemas oscilantes n∆o lineares que dependem de parÉmetros reais. Tais diagramas, que ilustram o comportamento global do sistema, s∆o gr†ficos que mostram algum aspecto da soluá∆o estacion†ria (p.e. a norma ou um componente) em funá∆o do parÉmetro sob consideraá∆o.Para demonstrar o mÇtodo proposto os autores utilizaram uma vers∆o simplificada do oscilador de Duffing para modelar um sistema massa-molaamortecedor, com uma mola "dura", onde o parÉmetro f°sico considerado foi a amplitude do termo foráante.Noutro trabalho Becker e Seydel (1981) consideraram uma equaá∆o especial de Duffing representando um modelo simples para a flambagem de uma viga sob vibraá∆o lateral foráada. Foram constru°dos diagramas de bifurcaá∆o que mostram um interessante comportamento das soluá‰es harmìnicas em funá∆o da freqÅància paramÇtrica de excitaá∆o.0 interesse desse trabalho, assim como Seydel (1980), tambÇm est† na compreens∆o do desempenho global de sistemas n∆o lineares, dissipativos e foráados, descritos por equaá‰es diferenciais de 2 ordem, mas do ponto de vista das trajet¢rias no espaáo de estados (soluá‰es peri¢dicas e aperi¢dicas). Para isso, s∆o apresentados alguns, resultados obtidos com um programa simples que roda em PC-486 utilizando o "software" Mathematica e a rotina instalada NDSolve [ ]. Uma equaá∆o diferencial simplificada de Duffing Ç utilizada para mostrar o comportamento global no regime permanente em funá∆o da amplitude do termo foráante

Apresentam-se  e discutem-se, quanto a arquitetura capacidade de modelagem e aproximaá∆o, as redes dos tipos "Perceptron", "Radial Basis Function" e "Functional Link Network", que tàm sido mais comumente usadas. Os esquemas  mais usuais de aplicaá‰es em problemas de controle s apresentados e discutidos, desde o treinamento de redes para modelar e representar ou o modelo dinÉmico ou o controlado atÇ as estruturas de controle com redes. No caso treinamento de redes, s∆o analisadas tanto a arquitetura geral de aprendizagem como a especializada, destacando que o problema central envolvido Ç um de identificaá∆o parÉmetros, que, de um modo geral, pode ser colocado como problema de otimizaá∆o de parÉmetros, contexto no qual visto, por exemplo, o algoritmo "Backpropagation". No caso das estruturas de controle com redes s∆o analisados os casos  do (i) sistema inverso direto, (ii) sistema inverso direto adaptativo, (iii) "internal model contro" (IMC) e (iv) sistema adaptativo com modelo de referància. Ao final, faz-se um relato de aplicaá‰es de destaque reportadas  na literatura, assim como uma apreciaá∆o cr°tica do estado arte no assunto e de perspectivas futuras

   83:  The purpose of this paper is to show how to use nonlinear control techniques and adaptive control to design attitude control algorithms for satellites. Basically  the satellite is modelled as a rigid body: lt has as control devices three reaction wheels, one for each axis; and the purpose of the controller is, to align the satellite with the orbital reference frame. The satellite is subjected lo the gravitational torque and a disturbance torque (e.g.. a drag torque or a radiation torque). Whose model is known, except for some parameters. Conditions for equilibrium under these circunstances are discussed and some possibilities for the satellite alignment are presented with their advantages and drawbacks.The controller is designed by suggesting a Liapunov function, constructed by making use of physical and mathematical considerations, and imposing conditions for stability. The same procedure can be applied to take into consideration the lack of knowledge about some satellite dynamical parameters and  or about the disturbance model. The algorithms so obtained are robust and can also be extended to satellites with flexible parts

   83:  No caso de satÇlites artificiais, em geral, um dos erros mais predominantes que afeta as efemÇrides, geradas pelos  procedimentos numÇricos de propagaá∆o de ¢rbitas, Ç o erro modelagem da foráa gravitacional terrestre. A an†lise e controle da miss∆o de um satÇlite terrestre de baixa altitude, particular, precisa de dados confi†veis e razoavelmente bons, efemÇrides de satÇlites e portanto Ç necess†rio, especialmente  neste caso, avaliar os erros orbitais, causados pela gravidade  anìmala da Terra. Tratando os erros na modelagem da funá∆o geopotencial, este trabalho visa desenvolver um procedimento estoc†stico para avaliar a ordem de magnitude dos erros propagaá‰es de ¢rbitas. As equaá‰es de movimento s∆o expressa, termos dos elementos esfÇricos, para ¢rbitas el°pticas, juntando os mÇtodos de estimaá∆o linear com a representaá∆o espectral da gravitaá∆o terrestre, as estimativas estat°sticas  das incertezas nos elementos orbitais s∆o deduzidos em termos suas covariÉncias. Depois de explicar todo o desenvolvimento matem†tico em detalhes, alguns testes preliminares s∆o feitos para analisar a validade da teoria desenvolvida

   83:  Atualmente a Rede Ferrovi†ria Federal - Superintendància Regional 5 (RFFSA - SR5) conta com um sistema antigo, porÇm seguro no controle do movimento di†rio dos trens. Verificou-se que seria interessante a RFFSA contar com um sistema de controle de tr†fego mais eficiente e moderno, o qual pudesse fornecer ao Centro de Controle Operacional (CCO) a posiá∆o dos trens em tempo real, ao longo das trajet¢rias descritas. A escolha recaiu sobre o Sistema Diferencial de Posicionamento Global (DGPS). Diversos testes foram realizados ao longo da linha fÇrrea (Curitiba -VÇu de Noiva) utilizando receptores Trimble DGPS 4000 RL/DL e um sistema para a comunicaá∆o entre as estaá‰es fixa e m¢vel. Cabe ressaltar que o receptor na estaá∆o fixa gera as correá‰es Ös pseudodistÉncias, as quais s∆o enviadas a estaá∆o m¢vel. Esta recebe as correá‰es e calcula a sua posiá∆o corrigida. Ap¢s realizados os levantamentos verificou-se uma precis∆o melhor que 3 metros em posiá∆o e melhor que 5 metros em altitude, resultados estes dentro das necessidades da RFFSA.Deste modo, com a finalidade de se ter um software: pr¢prio que forneáa a posiá∆o do trem em tempo real, est† sendo desenvolvido um algoritmo atravÇs da tÇcnica do filtro de Kalman. 0 movimento do trem Ç descrito atravÇs de sua equaá∆o do movimento. 0 desempenho do procedimento de estimaá∆o ser† analisado em termos de precis∆o, convergància e consistància estat°stica, comparando-se os resultados estimados com Öqueles obtidos pelos receptores Trimble DGPS

   83:  Este trabalho apresenta o desenvolvimento de um sistema de determinaá∆o de ¢rbitas de satÇlites terrestres com capacidade de estimar manobras de longo empuxo bem como manobras do tipo impulsivas. Manobra de longo empuxo (400N) Ç normalmente utilizada para transferàncias orbitais de satÇlites geo-estacion†rios. Manobras impulsivas podem ser utilizadas para satÇlites de sensoriamento remoto, para correá‰es de semi-eixo maior, excentricidade, inclinaá∆o e fase. Sistemas usuais n∆o oferecem normalmente a possibilidade de estimar a ¢rbita atravÇs de manobras. A abordagem usual Ç a de estimar a ¢rbita antes da manobra, e ap¢s a manobra. Este modo de operaá∆o pode requerer um intervalo longo de tempo para a aquisiá∆o de dados de rastreamento. O sistema proposto e em desenvolvimento permitir† a determinaá∆o de ¢rbita em curtos intervalos de tempo, estimados em menos de 3 horas ap¢s a manobra. Ser∆o descritas as modelagens das manobras, o modelo de perturbaá‰es adotado, a modelagem das medidas de rastreamento, bem como o mÇtodo de estimaá∆o utilizado. Resultados preliminares mostram um ¢timo n°vel de concordÉncia com sistemas de determinaá∆o de ¢rbitas usuais utilizados de forma restrita

   83:  Sensores de horizonte s∆o mecanismos do Subsistema de Controle de Atitude de satÇlites artificiais utilizados na determinaá∆o da orientaá∆o do satÇlite em relaá∆o a Terra. De um modo geral os sensores de horizonte s∆o constitu°dos de um sistema de varredura, de um sistema ¢ptico, que inclui um detector de radiaá∆o, e de uma eletrìnica de processamento de sinais. 0 modo de funcionamento do sensor baseia-se na varredura do campo de vis∆o do detector atravÇs da esfera celeste. Quando o campo de vis∆o cruza a atmosfera a radiaá∆o infra-vermelha proveniente do g†s carbìnico Ç sentida e um pulso (corda terrestre) Ç gerado pela eletrìnica de processamento de sinais. 0 comprimento da corda, quando comparado a um comprimento padr∆o, determina o Éngulo de rotaá∆o do satÇlite em torno de um eixo perpendicular ao eixo ¢ptico do instrumento. 0 mecanismo de varredura tambÇm gera um pulso de referància por rotaá∆o e uma assimetria do pulso em relaá∆o Ö corda implica numa rotaá∆o do satÇlite em torno do eixo ¢ptico do sensor. Os Éngulos de rolamento e arfagem s∆o obtidos atravÇs de transformaá∆o de coordenadas. A forma de onda t°pica para a corda, produzida pela varredura cìnica, apresenta uma amplitude irregular devido a variaá‰es na radiÉncia sobre a superf°cie. 0 sinal Ç limpo e tratado utilizando um circuito que limita a amplitude obtendo-se uma onda quadrada. Se o Sol estiver no caminho da varredura o sinal deve ser rejeitado o que pode ser feito atravÇs de v†rios mÇtodos entre os quais a rejeiá∆o em amplitude ou em largura de pulso, a inibiá∆o da sa°da quando a taxa de cruzamento de limiar Ç duplicada ou instalando um detector de ondas curtas para identificar e rejeitar o pulso solar. Esse trabalho descreve um mÇtodo simples para inibiá∆o do sinal em presenáa do Sol que tem a vantagem de n∆o necessitar incrementar∆o no "hardware" do sensor. Trata-se de um algoritmo a ser implementado a bordo que automaticamente inibe a sa°da do sinal caso o mesmo detecte que o Sol est† no caminho de varredura. Para isso o sensor dever† utilizar da informaá∆o do Éngulo de aspecto solar proveniente dos sensores solares do satÇlite

   83:  0 sistema de controle de atitude do satÇlite de sensoriamento remoto da MECB Ç substancialmente diferente de seus antecessores (SCDI e SCD2), com elevado grau de sofisticaá∆o. Os requisitos impostos pela miss∆o - alta precis∆o de apontamento e estabilidade acentuada de forma a garantir a qualidade da imagem - conduziu Ö adoá∆o de um sistema de controle embarcado com 3 tipos diferentes de atuadores e 4 tipos diferentes de sensores, controlados por um computador digital. Para atingir a confiabilidade estabelecida para o subsistema e ausància de SPF (single point falhire - ponto de falha £nica), todos os sensores atuadores e tambÇm a eletrìnica de controle s∆o redundados, aumentando ainda mais a complexidade do sistema. Neste quadro, verifica-se que o programa computacional embarcado torna-se peáa chave, e do seu correto funcionamento depender† toda a miss∆o. Torna-se assim imperioso garantir a qualidade do programa, impondo tÇcnicas modernas de computaá∆o e an†lise: linguagem de programaá∆o voltada para ambientes microprocessados; algoritmos de c†lculo avanáados sistemas para identificaá∆o, an†lise e recuperaá∆o de falhas, etc. O desenvolvimento do programa passa a ser controlado por meio de normas que regem todos os est†gios e configuraá‰es durante as diversas fases do desenvolvimento. Estabelecem ainda o conte£do da documentaá∆o em cada fase e as revis‰es necess†rias. Os procedimentos de teste do subsistema s∆o tambÇm fundamentais ao sucesso do projeto. Inicia-se com testes individuais em cada m¢dulo ou equipamento (testes funcionais), passa-se depois para testes do programa embarcado junto com a eletrìnica digital (com os sensores e atuadores sendo simulados por programas rodando em outra m†quina), finalizando com testes onde certo n£mero de equipamentos s∆o ligados ao computador de bordo. A descriá∆o detalhada dos testes, seus resultados e sua an†lise permitir∆o estabelecer a requerida confiabilidade e qualidade do subsistema de controle de atitude. Neste trabalho ser† apresentada a situaá∆o atual do projeto, bem como um planejamento para o desenvolvimento tanto do programa embarcado quanto dos testes do subsistema

   83:  Alguns satÇlites artificiais n∆o exigem alta precis∆o de tamento das antenas das estaá‰es terrenas para que seu sinal seja processado. Teorias anal°ticas como Kozai (1959) e Brouwer (1959) s∆o amplamente utilizadas  para esse fim. No entanto, satÇlites de baixa altitude inviabilizam  utilizaá∆o dessas teorias por um per°odo longo devido ao atrito atmosfÇrico . Um mÇtodo sem°-anal°tico pode melhorar o n°vel da propagaá∆o fazendo uso uma integraá∆o numÇrica para o calculo do decaimento do satÇlite e tornando anal°tica a propagaá∆o dos elementos mÇdios de Brouwer. A recuperaá∆o elementos osculadores pode ser assim, novamente obtida pela teoria anal°tica de Kozai (1959) e Brouwer (1959), para apontamento da antena e recepá∆o sinais do satÇlite

   83:  Em ¢rbitas sol-sincronas de baixa altitude, a influencia atrito atmosfÇrico e gravitacional do Sol alteram dois componentes importantes  na manutená∆o do sincronismo da ¢rbita: semi-eixo e inclinaá∆o respectivamente. Constantes ajustes s∆o necess†rios para que se mantenha o sincronismo. Shoda e Itoh (1981) adotam um critÇrio de ajuste que minimiza a utilizaá∆o de combust°vel nessas manobras para uma miss∆o de dois anos. Uma variaá∆o das influencias  e descriá∆o do critÇrio de ajuste Ç feita. Uma variaá∆o mÇtodo Ç  introduzida resultando sens°vel melhoria dos resultados

   83:  A crescente necessidade de se obter com mais precis∆o a trajet¢ria dos satÇlites artificiais terrestres, tem provocado o desenvolvimento  de teorias que procuram modelar as pequenas foráas respons†veis pela modificaá∆o, ao longo do tempo, dos elementos orbitais. Igualmente importantes  os efeitos destas perturbaá‰es na atitude do satÇlite, provocando alteraá‰es na sua orientaá∆o. Procura-se, aqui, mostrar as modelagens mais recentes encontradas na literatura; adapt†-las para serem utilizadas em computador em seguida aplic†-las a um satÇlite experimental. Os resultados s∆o analisados  tendo em vista a grandeza relativa entre as foráas, seu comportamento  longo da ¢rbita e os parÉmetros mais influentes

   83:  A especificaá∆o e a an†lise preliminar da miss∆o precisa de estimativas r†pidas de tempos de vida orbital de satÇlites, para varias opá‰es de injeá∆o. Este trabalho prop‰e um mÇtodo para a previs∆o r†pida e razoavelmente precisa do tempo de vida de satÇlites na faixa de altitude de  150-2.000 km. Utilizam-se equaá‰es de pequenas perturbaá‰es com o arrasto atmosfÇrico, como a foráa principal de perturbaá‰es. Mostra-se que, fazendo- se uma escolha correta de temperatura exosfàrica, o modelo atmosfÇrico "CIRA-1972" fornece bons resultados, com grande economia de tempo no computador. Faz-se uma an†lise do efeito de erro no Éngulo de injeá∆o sobre o tempo vida orbital, para um ve°culo de lanáamento e dois satÇlites hipotÇticos

   83:  Este trabalho prop‰e um procedimento para determinaá∆o de ¢rbita em tempo real de satÇlites artificiais terrestres, necess†rio para o conhecimento da trajet¢ria, a navegaá∆o e o controle do ve°culo. A determinaá∆o de ¢rbita apresenta dificuldades relacionadas Ö modelagem do movimento do satÇlite, alÇm de exigir requisitos de precis∆o e tempos de computaá∆o os dados observacionais colhidos por estaá‰es topocàntricas de rastreamento  s∆o processadas atravÇs do filtro de Kalman para obter a melhor estimativa  da ¢rbita segundo o critÇrio de m°nima de variÉncia. Um modelo complexo do movimento do satÇlite, o qual requer razo†veis tempos de processamento em computador, inviabilizam a estimaá∆o de ¢rbita em tempo real. Por outro lado, um modelo aproximado compromete o emprego do filtro de Kalman, produzindo a divergància  das estimativas, caracterizando a incoerància estat°stica entre os erros estimados e os res°duos das observaá‰es. Entretanto, incluindo no modelo do movimento um n°vel de ru°do adequado que exprima o desconhecimento parcial das perturbaá‰es n∆o modeladas, previne-se a divergància e obtem-se respostas satisfat¢rias do filtro. Assim, elabora-se um procedimento que estime adaptativamente tal n°vel de ru°do para que o filtro de Kalman forneáa estimativas requeridas dentro de precis‰es satisfat¢rias

   83:  This work studies the solar panels deployment of the Chinese-Brazilian satellite CBERS. The problem solution demands some deployment tests and the development of two different dynamic simulation models: one more complex related to the laboratory and another one related to orbit conditions. This work begins with a description of the deployment mechanisms, of the test device and of the deployment dynamic problem. The problem formulation is discussed and the use of a computer package for dynamic analysis of mechanisms is justified. The dynamic simulation models, the test results, the adjustment of the model parameters to fit the simulation to the test results, the laboratory and the in-orbit simulation results are presented. The importance of the inclusion in the dynamic models of the solar panel synchronizing mechanisms, of the aerodynamic forces of the solar panels due to the laboratory atmosphere, and of the solar panels initial deformations are discussed.

   83:  In the mechanical engineering moving system's field the radial journal bearing is one of the great interest. It consists of a circular inner cylinder (the rotor) that turns inside a hollow cylinder of slightly larger radius (the stator). The cavity between the cylinders is filled with a lubricant and any load carried by the rotor must be supported by the fluid forces exerted by the lubricant on the rotor. The system can be described by a set of four first order's nonlinear ordinary differential equations which the fluid forces are approximate solution of partial differential equations and shows a great richness of behavior same at the simplest case of cavitation model, autonomous, unforced and balanced-mass rotor system. Rigorous geometrical constraints are impose on the moving of the rotor's center about stator's center to avoid the contact between them. Otherwise, the contact could well result in bearing failure. Starting from the Reynolds approximation for the long bearing the paper uses numerical methods for bifurcation problems to calculate Hopf bifurcation points and numerical methods of continuation to obtain branching of periodic orbits that emanate from stationary solutions. The paper also shows the amplitude and frequency of periodic solutions as a function of rotor's angular velocity for the low, medium and high loads

   83:  This paper describes the mechanical structure and the attitude control system of the gondola that carries the MASCO experiment. This is a gamma ray telescope that flies suspended by a balloon at an altitude of 40 km. The gondola is a truss structure that shall survive the landing loads and fulfil several requirements concerned with the mechanical interfaces and constraints of the transportation, launching and recovery. An attitude control system has the objective of pointing and stabilizing the telescope moving the gondola in azimuth and the telescope in elevation. There are several targets to be observed during the flight and the telescope must hold the attitude for more than one hour towards each one. Several types of sensors and actuators are employed. The system is computer controlled and the control software comprises several modes of operation according to the phase of the mission and the angular distance from the target

   83:  A conquista do espaáo comeáou h† menos de quarenta anos, se tomarmos como seu marco inicial o lanáamento do primeiro Sputnik. Antes de 1957 houve apenas o trÉnsito efàmero de alguns foguetes pelo vazio que nos circunda. A aviaá∆o, confinada ao aconchego da atmosfera terrestre, muito alÇm do espaáo exterior, Ç, por natureza, diferente da Astron†utica. De qualquer modo, tanto os avi‰es como os bal‰es estratosfÇricos s∆o do nosso sÇculo, apenas um pouco menos recentes que as espaáonaves.Recent°ssimas s∆o tambÇm muitas outras conquistas tecnol¢gicas, cujas conseqÅàncias de longo prazo n∆o podemos sequer vislumbrar, atÇ porque a cada avanáo do conhecimento e da tÇcnica sucedem outros, e h† complexas relaá‰es entre eles. (Estou usando palavras como "conquista" e "avanáo" para evocar a idÇia de dom°nio de um novo territ¢rio, desta feita no mundo do saber fazer. Tais palavras n∆o significam necessariamente premoniá∆o de um futuro feliz para a humanidade. Toda expans∆o envolve oportunidades e riscos. As conquistas de hoje, como as grandes navegaá‰es do passado, s∆o aventuras.) A geraá∆o e distribuiá∆o de energia abundante e barata, as telecomuniá‰es, a inform†tica e a biotecnologia s∆o exemplos desses avanáos da tÇcnica. No que se refere Ös ciàncias da natureza, ouvimos falar a cada momento de descobertas not†veis. A matem†tica parece mais que recuperada da crise existencial dos paradoxos. AtÇ nas ciàncias sociais aqui e acol† temos not°cia de algum progresso! Por tudo isso, nosso tempo Ç singular na hist¢ria: n∆o apenas por ser Idade de extremos", mas especialmente por testemunhar uma expans∆o sem precedente no poder dos Estados, corporaá‰es, grupos sociais e indiv°duos. Poder de uns perante os outros e poder de todos diante da Natureza, para o bem e para o mal.Como situar e avaliar a importÉncia e as conseqÅàncias da exploraá∆o do espaáo c¢smico no mÇlange das transformaá‰es contemporÉneas? N∆o pretendo fazà-lo. Primeiro porque (acabei de deixar claro) seria dific°limo. Ademais porque, felizmente, o tema proposto para este ensaio Ç outro, bem menos poderoso! Devo escrever sobre o que o Brasil e a Franáa tàm feito na exploraá∆o espacial. Tenciono, ent∆o, relatar como a interaá∆o do Brasil com a Franáa nesse campo foi importante para n¢s no passado, e sugerir como devemos cooperar no futuro. Disso poderei tratar com proveito para o leitor, dado que participei intensamente daquele que foi, com todas suas frustraá‰es, o relacionamento bilateral mais prof°cuo atÇ hoje para o desenvolvimento dos programas brasileiros de foguetes e satÇlites. Refiro-me ao relacionamento que tivemos com a Franáa no per°odo 1976-1988.Neste ponto Ç justo que o leitor pergunte: se o tema Ç este, bem definido e interessante, qual o prop¢sito de fazer no in°cio do trabalho consideraá‰es t∆o sobranceiras? De fato, delas dever°amos aportar em alguma conclus∆o. Mas j† me alonguei demais, tenho de abordar imediatamente a pauta. Se o leitor quiser volver ao assunto mais genÇrico, acompanhe-me com paciància atÇ o ep°logo. Quando l† chegarmos, se n∆o me faltarem tempo, papel e uma dose m¢dica de engenho, hei de encontrar o arremate deste pr¢logo, ou pelo menos alguma outra provocaá∆o

   83:  FreqÅentemente se necessita efetuar colagens de chapas finas de materiais com diferentes coeficientes de dilataá∆o, e as peáas coladas ir∆o ser utilizadas em temperaturas diferentes daquela de cura, ou atÇ mesmo serem submetidas a ciclagem tÇrmica durante a sua vida em serviáo, ou ainda operar∆o com gradiente tÇrmico na direá∆o perpendicular as folhas. Exemplos desta situaá∆o s∆o as colagens de: chapas resistoras em elementos de simulaá∆o do combust°vel em reatores nucleares de placa, filmes aquecedores em geral, placas de circuito impresso sobre bases de alum°nio em sistemas eletrìnicos, cÇlulas solares sobre painÇis de satÇlites, e colagens aeron†uticas em geral. Nestas colagens desenvolvem-se tens‰es de cisalhamento no adesivo e tens‰es normais de traá∆o ou compress∆o nas chapas (aderentes). Estas tens‰es dependem da espessura das chapas e da camada de adesivo, da presenáa de filmes intermedi†rios, das temperaturas de cura e serviáo, da maior dimens∆o da junta, e propriedades mecÉnicas do adesivo e aderentes. Neste trabalho apresentam-se um modelo matem†tico da distribuiá∆o de tens‰es no adesivo e aderentes devido a dilataá∆o tÇrmica diferencial e critÇrios de projeto de juntas quanto a tens‰es tÇrmicas. As tens‰es m†ximas admiss°veis s∆o fixadas com base em uma revis∆o sucinta da literatura quanto a fadiga est†tica e dinÉmica de adesivos e juntas coladas, e quanto a concentraá∆o de tens‰es nos ensaios de cisalhamento, fadiga e fadiga est†tica/durabilidade descritos nas normas ASTM D-1002, ASTM D 3166, ASTM D 2918, respectivamente. Estuda-se tambÇm a propagaá∆o de trincas devido a tens∆o tÇrmica em juntas para avaliar-se os efeitos de pequenos sub-dimensionamentos de juntas deste tipo

   83:  Este trabalho tem por objetivo o estudo das manobras orbitais necess†rias para corrigir os efeitos da perturbaá∆o de um terceiro corpo na ¢rbita de um satÇlite artificial da terra. Para o estudo dos efeitos das perturbaá‰es, a express∆o da perturbaá∆o do terceiro corpo ser† obtida e expandida em Polinìmios de Legendre e os primeiros termos ser∆o isolados para estudo. A seguir, as Equaá‰es Planet†rias de Lagrange ser∆o utilizadas para obtená∆o das express‰es das taxas de variaá∆o no tempo dos elementos Keplerianos. Essas express‰es ser∆o ent∆o integradas numericamente ao longo do tempo para o estudo do comportamento da ¢rbita. Em paralelo a isso, um modelo totalmente numÇrico, baseado no problema restrito de tràs corpos em tràs dimens‰es ser† desenvolvido para comparaá∆o com os resultados obtidos de diferentes ordens do estudo anal°tico. Com isso, pretende-se estudar, com v†rios modelos, importantes caracter°sticas desta perturbaá∆o, tais como: existància de um Éngulo cr°tico para a estabilidade das ¢rbitas, soluá‰es estacion†rias, etc...TambÇm ser† estudado outro item importante relacionado a esse problema, a captura gravitacional de um ve°culo espacial pela Lua. Captura gravitacional Ç um fenìmeno que ocorre quando uma part°cula muda sua ¢rbita de hiperb¢lica para el°ptica somente com o uso de gravidade. Para realizar esse estudo, ser† considerado que um ve°culo espacial se encontra em uma ¢rbita em tomo da Lua e Ç perturbado pela Terra. Para um certo conjunto de condiá‰es iniciais esse ve°culo espacial ir† escapar da esfera de influància da Lua sem a necessidade de manobras orbitais. Esse tipo de fenìmeno Ç chamado de escape gravitacional. Para cada escape gravitacional existe uma manobra de captura gravitacional (basta inverter o sentido do tempo). Essas manobras possuem importantes aplicaá‰es para miss‰es lunares

   83:  Some time ago, Vander Velde and He proposed a new design method for large space structure (LSS) control systems using on-off thrusters based on their approximate solution to the problem of the weighted time/fuel optimal control of the linear dynamic model of a flexible spacecraft with many bounded controls and any initial state (problem 1) . Despite its practical advantages, one of its disadvantages resided in its final behavior: a final cycle with non-negligible dimensions. This called for studies to relate their characteristics with cost function parameters (fuel weights) without simulating the system. One possibility considered by the author consists of: 1) formulating and testing two quasilinearization methods under the same conditions by comparing their estimates with correspondent values from simulations; 2) using the best ones for each range to plot those relations for a relevant range of the fuel weight. The results of this conjecture were obtained by Souza, and are summarized in this work. Limit cycles have been studied for a long time. Particularly, what seems to be very interesting ones were presented by Vander Velde and He as results of their design method. In this work a first attempt is made to analyse limit cycles as those of Vander Velde. The motivation is the possibility of analysing them by relating final cycle characteristics with cost function parameters (fuel weights) without simulating the system. To do so two quasilinearization methods are formulated and tested under the same conditions. Their estimates are compared with correspondent values from simulations. The best ones for each subrange are iteratively used to plot those relations for a relevant range of the fuel weight. Extensions to more complicated problems are discussed. It is found that the first method is better in the upper subrange than the second, and vice-versa

   83:  The Sub-orbital platform (PSO) is a recoverable vehicle which is being developing at INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) to be launch by a rocket (SONDA-III) of the IAV (Instituto de Atividades Espacias). The objective of PSO is to test some attitude control equipments which are being developing by INPE as well as to measure the acceleration in three axis in order to carry out some kind of microgravity experiments in future missions. After the rocket last stage burn the PSO is released in free flying with a spin of about 180 rpm. This paper presents the procedure adopted to perform the despin and the three axis angular velocity reduction of the PSO up to residual values of the order of 0.001rad/s. The PSO control system is composed of only four thrusters of 2N strategically placed across the PSO longitudinal axis, which cannot coincide with PSO mass centre. This configuration allows to produce torques about only one axes or about all three axis, simultaneously, depending of the control strategy used. In order to check the control system performance one analyses these two control strategies. In the first one, the despin is performed initially only about the axis with greater angular velocity followed the despin about the others two axes. In the second one, the despin is performed in the three axes simultaneously. The results of the simulation have shown that in both cases the control system was able to perform the despin very rapid as well as to reduce the angular velocities to values required for the mission

   83:  0 modelo unificado de estados, desenvolvido por Altman, foi criado para o estudo do movimento de ¢rbita e de atitude. Os parÉmetros deste modelo s∆o momentos (uma forma direta para a atitude e de forma paramÇtrica para a ¢rbita) e os parÉmetros de Euler, representando as transformaá‰es de rotaá‰es dos eixos de referància. As principais vantagens deste modelo est∆o em sua utilizaá∆o na determinaá∆o de ¢rbita e de atitude, porque os parÉmetros que representam a ¢rbita s∆o regularizados e tambÇm devido a inter-relaá∆o que existe entre as duas classes de movimento, principalmente em satÇlites de ¢rbita baixa. Neste trabalho s∆o apresentados os resultados do comportamento da parte orbital do modelo, numa aplicaá∆o em determinaá∆o de ¢rbita utilizando o filtro de Kalman. S∆o discutidas as implicaá‰es da singularidade da matriz de covariÉncia dos quatÇrnions orbitais e apresentados os resultados de uma estimaá∆o feita com medidas de "range" de satÇlite SCD-1 fornecidas pelo centro de controle de satÇlites da MECB

   83:  A teoria hodogr†fica foi desenvolvida inicialmente por Hamilton/Mobius e meados do sÇculo XIX, baseando-se no vetor- de Runge-Lenz. Esta teoria foi utilizada no estudo de trajet¢rias orbitais no espaáo vetorial da velocidade, demonstrando que as cìnicas do espaáo de posiá∆o s∆o representadas por c°rculos no espaáo hodogr†fico, cujos £nicos parÉmetros que variam s∆o o raio da circunferància e a distÉncia de seu centro Ö origem dos eixos. 0s parÉmetros hodogr†ficos s∆o regularizados, evitando as singularidade cl†ssicas e oferecendo vantagens computacionais. Ironicamente, as implicaá‰es fundamentais da teoria hodogr†fica foram ignoradas ou perdidas no desenvolvimento da teoria da mecÉnica celeste atÇ a dÇcada de 60 quando Altman desenvolveu a teoria hodogr†fica moderna a partir da equaá∆o da energia para ¢rbita de um corpo num campo central. Este novo enfoque da teoria apresenta significado f°sico das parÉmetros hodogr†ficos, demonstrando que s∆o funá‰es da energia e do momento angular. Dentre as v†rias aplicaá‰es que a teria hodogr†fica permite, este trabalho apresenta um modelo de estudo orbital, desenvolvido por Altman e denominado modelo unificado de estados, que oferece, dentre outras vantagens, a possibilidade da determinaá∆o de ¢rbita e de atitude com excelentes propriedades numÇricas e vantagens computacionais

   88:  misalignmentattitude errors 
   83:  Infrared horizon sensors are accurate instruments employed in satellites for Earth referred sensing and attitude control. These optical devices are affected in accuracy by several sources of errors. One of these sources, namely the misalignment between the rotating axis and the optical axis of a conical scanning horizon sensor, has been mentioned in the literature but hasn't being studied in sufficient detail. This paper aims to model and to study such a misalignment. The operation principle of a typical conical scanner in a low Earth sunsynchronous orbit is described as much as the mathematical modeling of the misalignment and the simulation procedure. Numerical simulations are presented and they show that the magnitude of the errors vary with orbital parameters and the sensor position with respect to the spacecraft. These simulations also show that the attitude errors are small for ordinary misalignments. Results for two sensor heads are also shown

   83:  The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active microwave sensor installed in aircraft and satellites. It produces high resolution images that can be used in remote sensing activities. The SAR images are influenced mainly by the geometry of antenna illumination (Incidence, angle), by the parameters of the radar (polarization, frequency, pulse width, antenna pattern) an by the electromagnetics properties of the scene. It has some advantages in comparison with optical sensors. Some of them are the capability of imaging through clouds and at night. An example of this is the Pioneer mission I Venus. With the SAR It is possible to obtain a image of forest trees or the soil of that forest.The SAR is a coherent device and as all coherent processes such as laser or sonar 11 image is obtained with speckle noise. The speckle is a multiplicative noise caused by the roughness of the scene when the roughness is comparable with the electromagnetic radiation wavelength. The speckle makes difficult the visualization and the automatic interpretation of the images. There are several techniques for speckle reduction. A difficult problem in the test c speckle reduction algorithms is the simulation of realistic images with particularities that can be used to infer the ability of the algorithm in preserve the edges and the resolution of the image. It is showed in this work how realistic SAR images can be simulated through the SAR Point Spread Function. The Point Spread Function represents the image of a point target observed by the SAR and it defines the image resolution and the pixels correlation. Some examples of simulated images are showed for the E-SAR from German Space Agency, DLR. These activities at ITA are supported by UNDP/ICAO Project BRA-092/006, objective 6

   83:  The purpose of this paper is to show how to use Liapunov functions to derive attitude control laws for rigid satellites subjected to the gravitational torque when their mass properties are not well known.Usually the design of the attitude control law for a satellite is based on a linearized model that is valid only for the region of normal operation. In order to obtain controllers that give a better performance for large angle manoevers is necessary to use nonlinear techniques. One of the more sucessful uses Liapunov functions. A Liapunov function based on physical (energy) and mathematical considerations is proposed and the control algorithm is obtained by forcing its time derivative to comply with the conditions for asymptotic stability. During this process the satellite mass properties are considered to be known. In order to deal with the case when this condition does not happen, a new procedure is proposed. A new Liapunov function is built taking into account the difference between the design parameters and the real parameters and using the usual procedure of adaptive control, a mechanism is designed, allowing the parameter on line estimation. An analysis of the new algorithm is performed in terms of the new conditions for stability and suggestions are made for its improvement

   83:  Os cristais pseudo-bin†rios de PbxSnl-xTe e HgxCd1-xTe s∆o a base de alguns sensores eletro-¢ticos de infravermelho, Macrocristais dos mesmos s∆o crescidos com o objetivo de se obter "waffers" que servem como substrato para a deposiá∆o de outros filmes cristalinos. A qualidade e eficiància do dispositivo final depende em grande parte da perfeiá∆o cristalina e da horriogeneidade composicional desse substrato. Dois mÇtodos s∆o comumente empregados no crescimento de macrocristais desses materiais: Bridgman-Stockbarger(BS) e Vapor-L°quido S¢lido(VMS), que s∆o basicamente tÇcnicas de solidificaá∆o direcionada a partir da fase l°quida(BS) ou l°quida-vapor(VMS), Em ambiente de microgravidade, Ç poss°vel conseguir um regime de crescimento aonde as correntes de convecá∆o natural na fase l°quida s∆o bastante reduzidas, obtendo-se um cristal que exibe uma regi∆o axial homogànea com respeito Ö composiá∆o. A an†lise composicional dos transientes inicial e final, detect†veis na barra do macrocristal ap¢s o crescimento, permite a recuperaá∆o de constantes f°sicas caracter°sticas do material crescido, e de parÉmetros f°sicos relacionados com a velocidade e regime de crescimento. Neste trabalho, apresentamos alguns mÇtodos de an†lise de dados experimentais de composiá∆o em cristais de PbxSnl-xTe e similares, crescidos em regime difusivo. Estes mÇtodos permitem a recuperaá∆o da constante de difus∆o m£tua na fase l°quida e da taxa de microsegregaá∆o durante o crescimento. Estes parÉmetros f°sicos s∆o essenciais para o projeto e otimizaá∆o do crescimento alÇm de serem de interesse fundamental para a compreens∆o dos processos de transporte sob varias influàncias externas (campo gravitacional, campos magnÇticos, velocidade e perfil tÇrmico do forno, etc.). Descrevemos ainda mÇtodos desenvolvidos no LAS/INPE para a an†lise quantitativa bidimensional do formato da interface l°quido-s¢lido e do perfil radial de composiá∆o, que s∆o controlados basicamente pelo acoplamento tÇrmico e perfil de temperatura do forno. Finalmente, apresentamos a aplicaá∆o dessas tÇcnicas a resultados experimentais obtidos por crescimento BS difi†sivo em ampolas finas, e por crescimento VMS nos laborat¢rios do LAS/INPE, e simulaá‰es preliminares em computador que auxiliam a identificar as condiá‰es ¢timas em que os experimentos em microgravidade devem ser conduzidos

   83:  In the past few decades, satellite services have had an ever increasing participation in the daily life of contemporary societies. Concurrently, the market for space hardware has steadily expanded and by now the manufacturing and commercialization of space satellites have established themselves as an important economical activity in many countries, assuming a visible position in the so-called aerospace industry. A significant step towards the development of a national space industry ill Brazil was given at the end of the 70's, with the establishment of a governmental program, named Miss∆o Espacial Completa Brasileira (MECB), aimed at the acquisition and development of space technology through the manufacturing of four satellites and the respective launchers. A milestone of the program was the successful launching last year of the first brazillan-made satellite, the SatÇlite de Coleta de Dados 1 (SCD1). The SCD1 is a small data collecting satellite and up to now has been fully operational. A second satellite (SCD2) is by now in an advanced stage of manufacturing and has its qualification tests scheduled for next year.One of the natural objectives of the MECB program has been the qualification of brazilian industries as suppliers of space qualified equipments and components. The  Instituto Nacional the Pesquisas Espacials (INPE), which is in charge of the satellite sub-program of MECB, has accumulated a great deal of experience in this area. Owing to a multitude of factors, mainly of a technological character such as availability of technological information, technological profile of brazilian industries, etc.... the strategies of industrial policy put forward by INPE have wildly varied from one hardware item to another, with varying results. A particular approach was followed in the qualification of a national supplier of space solar panels. By many standards, this qualification program has been considered very successful, a judgement which is reinforced by the fact that the solar panels of the SCD2 satellite have already been fully manufactured in Brazil, at a competitive price.It is our objective in this paper to give an account of the strategy followed in the aforementioned qualification program, discussing in detail its several phases and also their practical implementation. We conclude the paper with a brief discussion of the cost-effectiveness of the overall qualification program

   83:  This paper describes the solar array generator (sag) which will power the China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite CBERS. The CBERS is a cooperation program established in 1988 between the Popular Republic of China and Brazil, to launch and operate two satellites for earth resources observation. The CBERS' SAG design and manufacturing is under INPE's responsibility. In this paper, a summary of the electrical requirements are presented along with a discussion of the design criteria and the solution found for the solar cell configuration. Results of simulated in-orbit electrical performance are presented to demonstrate that the design can meet the specified requirements. The manufacturing of the electrical part of the CBERS' SAG, its work breakdown structure, and the qualification test program are also discussed. The CBERS' Solar Array Generator is a single wing deployable type, composed of three identical solar panels, designed to generate 1,100 Watts at end-of-mission. The CBERS'SAG is divided into two circuits, one to recharge the batteries, named SG1, and another to meet the equipment loads, named SG2. The SG1 circuit is designed to generate 590 Watts at 58.1 Volts. The SG2 circuit is designed to generate 510 Watts at 31.4 Volts. The ideal results obtained from the design criteria are compared with the actual solution found for solar cell arrangement over the panel structure for each one of these circuits. The manufacturing of CBERS' SAG involves companies from three different countries. The solar cells and coverglasses will be supplied by a chinese institute. These cells and glasses will be sent to Germany for solar modules manufacturing. To make possible transporting the solar modules from Germany to Brazil a special manufacturing design was necessary. The solar modules will be laied down over the panel structures in a brazilian company, where the solar panel manufacturing will be completed. After panel and cabling manufacturing, the solar array generator wing will be assembled and tested at INPE's facilities. This special work breakdown structure is reflected in the qualification test program. The particularities of this qualification program which reflects the involvements defined in the work breakdown structure are discussed in the last part of this paper

   83:  No in°cio da dÇcada de 80 o INPE iniciou suas atividades desenvolvimento de sistemas espaciais motivado pelo uso crescente, no pa°s, de produtos e serviáos fornecidos por satÇlites. Assim Ç que foi iniciada, em 1980, a Miss∆o Espacial Completa Brasileira-MECB com o objetivo de construir e lanáar quatro pequenos satÇlites com tecnologia nacional. Mais tarde essa miss∆o foi estendida para incluir um quinto satÇlite. AlÇm dos satÇlites, a MECB inclui tambÇm o desenvolvimento, no pa°s dos lanáadores dos satÇlites e a implantaá∆o, em AlcÉntara-MA do Centro de Lanáamento. Hoje, o primeiro satÇlite da sÇrie esta em ¢rbita (foi lanáado em fevereiro de 1993) funciona normalmente e enviando dados hidrol¢gicos e meteorol¢gicos coletados das plataformas de coleta de dados espalhadas pelo territ¢rio nacional. O segundo e terceiro satÇlites, semelhantes  ao primeiro, tàm previs∆o de lanáamento para 1995 e 1996 respectivamente. Os dois £ltimos satÇlites da sÇrie destinam a imagear o territ¢rio brasileiro com fins de possibilitar monitoramento de recursos naturais e o controle ambiental, em outras aplicaá‰es. Atualmente revisa-se a miss∆o desses satÇlites para melhor adapt†-la Ös necessidades presentes

   83:  O Espectr¢grafo Solar Brasileiro (Brazilian Solar Spectroscope, BSS) Ç um radiotelesc¢pio de alta sensibilidade e alta resoluá∆o temporal e espectral, que est† sendo utilizado nas observaá‰es de explos‰es solares, ocorridas na faixa de frequància decimÇtrica, realizadas no Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE). Um sistema para aquisiá∆o digital do sinal observado pelo BSS foi desenvolvido, podendo gerar um fluxo de dados de atÇ 35 Mbytes/hora. A an†lise destes dados apresenta grande complexidade pois, alÇm do grande volume, o sinal dos fenìmenos observados sobrep‰e-se Ö emiss∆o solar de fundo, sendo que ambos os sinais sofrem variaá‰es de intensidade no tempo e em frequància. Esta complexidade dificulta ao astrìnomo o tratamento, visualizaá∆o e an†lise destes dados. Assim, este trabalho prop‰e um sistema para tratamento e visualizaá∆o de dados astronìmicos espectrais, denominado BSSView. Este sistema foi projetado e desenvolvido seguindo modelos da †rea de Visualizaá∆o Cient°fica, e Ç composto por m¢dulos espec°ficos destinados ao prÇ-processamento, visualizaá∆o e p¢s-processamento de dados, desenvolvidos na linguagem Interactive Data Language (IDL) e que disp‰e de uma interface gr†fica com o usu†rio. O BSSView possui a vantagem de permitir a visualizaá∆o em tempo quase real dos dados provenientes do BSS, possibilitando assim, modificar os parÉmetros de aquisiá∆o, conforme o fenìmeno observado. O sistema j† est† operacional e diariamente, entre 11:30 e 19:30 UT, dados referentes a diversos flares solares est∆o sendo adquiridos e visualizados, permitindo posterior an†lise. ABSTRACT: The Brazilian Solar Spectroscope (BSS) is a radiotelescope that features high sensitivity and high spectral and temporal resolutions. The BSS is currently being used for the observation of solar explosions, in the decimetric bandwidth, at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE). An acquisition system was developed to digitise BSS signals up to 35 MBytes per hour. Besides this high dataflow there is the inherent complexity of such observations as the signal intensity of the observed phenomena is superposed by a continuous Sun background emission and both signals vary in time and frequency. As the processing, visualization and analysis of such data are difficult for the astronomer, this work presents a system to perform this tasks, the BSSView. It was designed following Scientific Visualization models and it is composed by specific modules aimed for preprocessing, visualization and post-processing of observed data, provided with user graphical interfaces and written in the Interactive Data Language (IDL). As BSSview allows near real time visualization it provides a feedback for the modification of the acquisition parameters, according to the observed phenomena. This system is currently operational and processes data daily between 11:30 AM and 7:30 PM. Several datasets related to solar flares were already acquired and visualized, being available to further analysis

   83:  Os conceitos b†sicos da teoria de controle linear s∆o aplicados para a an†lise do sistema controle de atitude de um satÇlite artificial. O sistema de controle estudado utiliza como atuador uma roda de reaá∆o, cujo vetor momento angular gerado tem liberdade de movimento de rotaá∆o em torno de dois eixos perpendiculares entre si, isto Ç, a roda tem dois graus de liberdade. Esse tipo de montagem, conhecida como "double-gimbaled wheel system" permite que sejam torques de controle em torno dos tràs eixos do satÇlite, embora, o controle da velocidade angular da roda seja feito somente em torno de dois eixos. AtravÇs do dimensionamento da roda e correta seleá∆o de sua velocidade angular, Ç poss°vel cancelar os torques perturbadores, por meio da troca de momento angular com o satÇlite, restando realizar somente ajustes peri¢dicos momento angular para o controle dos torques perturbadores seculares. Um outro aspecto importante desta estratÇgia de controle est† associada a necessidade de utilizaá∆o de somente  dois sensores de atitude, fato que muito simplifica o sistema de controle. A avaliaá∆o desempenho do sistema Ç feita no modo de operaá∆o nominal, onde,os efeitos dos torques perturbadores s∆o mais relevantes. Propriedades como massa, dimens‰es do satÇlite e se requisitos de operaá∆o s∆o considerados para um satÇlite do tipo geoestacion†rio. O torque perturbador considerado Ç devido a press∆o de radiaá∆o solar. A condiá∆o para a estabilidade do sistema foi verificada atravÇs da funá∆o de transferància do sistema. O desempenho sistema de controle foi analisado avaliando a resposta do sistema a torques perturbado impulsivos e as condiá‰es iniciais arbitr†rias. Tais simulaá‰es mostraram que a estratÇgia controle empregada foi capaz de amortecer as oscilaá‰es iniciais e controlar a atitude do satÇlite num intervalo de tempo menor do que cinco minutos

   83:  Em trabalho anterior [1], desenvolvido pelo aluno Gustavo Baldo Carvalho, estudou-se o problema de identificaá∆o de estrelas com o aux°lio de informaá‰es provenientes de sensores n∆o estelares. Prosseguindo com aquele trabalho foi analisado o caso onde tal informaá∆o n∆o Ç dispon°vel. Assim, ap¢s extensa an†lise bibliogr†fica, a determinaá∆o de atitude em tràs eixos foi feita a partir somente de observaá‰es de sensores estelares. A simulaá∆o tomou por base o cat†logo de estrelas do Observat¢rio Nacional, supondo uma distribuiá∆o Gaussiana de erros nas medidas e utilizando o mÇtodo de m°nimos quadrados linearizados.A identificaá∆o autìnoma de estrelas foi realizada por um mÇtodo baseado na comparaá∆o da separaá∆o angular entre pares de estrelas observadas com seus respectivos valores catalogados, segundo critÇrio de matriz de notas[2]. A comparaá∆o entre os resultados obtidos foi feita a partir de estat°sticas originadas do mÇtodo de Monte Carlo, explorando diversas configuraá‰es em termos de concentraá∆o de estrelas e sua distribuiá∆o espacial

   83:  Em geral um satÇlite precisa apontar, atravÇs de uma manobra de atitude, ou ficar apontado para uma determinada regi∆o do espaáo. Como exemplo, muitos satÇlites precisam ficar apontados para a Terra. Outros satÇlites apontam uma face na direá∆o do sol ou certas estrelas de interesse, outros ainda s∆o projetados para apontar primeiro para um objeto e depois para algum outro. FreqÅentemente parte do satÇlite (uma antena de comunicaá∆o) deve apontar para a regi∆o da Terra, enquanto outra parte (um painel solar) deve apontar para o sol. Para se atingir os objetivos da miss∆o, a estabilizaá∆o da atitude e o sistema de controle s∆o partes importantes do projeto do satÇlite

   83:  A primeira etapa do trabalho foi simular as equaá‰es  diferenciais do movimento do satÇlite em termos dos Éngulos roll, pitch e yaw. Em seguida quatro equaá‰es contendo parÉmetros de EULER foram adicionadas Ös tràs primeiras com finalidade de postumamente permitir a aplicaá∆o das equaá‰es controle da atitude do satÇlite. Os quatro parÉmetros de EULER tornaram poss°vel a aplicaá∆o do torque gravitacional que embora pequena expressividade em relaá∆o ao arrasto alterava a atitude satÇlite de maneira bem sutil tendo em vista a pequena ordem grandeza das velocidades angulares. A preocupaá∆o maior era obter medida da atitude do satÇlite para doravante aplicar o controle posicionar o satÇlite com uma orientaá∆o fixa em torno de s ¢rbita terrestre. Fez-se ent∆o necess†rio a escolha de referencial adequado para a medida dos Éngulos que davam a posiá∆o  do satÇlite. Tendo em vista que os sensores fixos no satÇlite da * leitura dos Éngulos em relaá∆o a um referencial fixo no satÇlite  as equaá‰es de movimento davam os valores destes Éngulos relaá∆o a um referencial inercial, tornou-se imprescind°vel adoá∆o de um sistema de referància £nico onde tanto a leitura de sensores como o resultado dos c†lculos computacionais podiam ser  medidos. Como era de interesse manter o satÇlite com uma de sua  faces voltada para a superf°cie terrestre, tomou-se como referància  para as medidas dos Éngulos o referencial orbital

   83:  As equaá‰es diferenciais tàm ampla aplicaá∆o na resoluá∆o de problemas complexos sobre movimento, crescimento, vibraá‰es, eletricidade e magnetismo, aerodinÉmica, termodinÉmico hidrodinÉmica, energia nuclear e todo tipo de fenìmeno f°sico, qu°mico, biol¢gico ou social, que  envolva taxas de variaá∆o de quantidades vari†veis. O avanáo nas tÇcnicas anal°ticas, em especial a teoria das bifurcaá‰es, fornece informaá‰es valiosas a respeito de mudanáas qualitativas no comportamento de sistemas diferenciais  que dependem de v†rios parÉmetros e est∆o proporcionando uma melhor compreens∆o Ö fenìmenos, principalmente daqueles descritos por sistemas de Equaá‰es Diferenciais Ordin†rias (EDO's). Acontece que as tÇcnicas anal°ticas n∆o respondem adequadamente aos desafios impostos pelo avanáo cient°fico e tecnol¢gico. Torna-se necess†rio lanáar m∆o de mÇtodos numÇricos algoritmos para obtená∆o de detalhes quantitativos em uma gama de problemas particulares.Ocorre, ent∆o, que tem  crescido a exploraá∆o detalhada de certas regi‰es do espaáo parÉmetros visto que uma exploraá∆o global as vezes Ç invi†vel para sistemas de EDO's n∆o  lineares que dependem de v†rios parÉmetros. O objetivo da teoria das bifurcaá‰es Ç ter a compreens∆o do processo de transiá∆o para turbulància. A soluá∆o de uma equaá∆o diferencial pode exibir dr†sticas mudanáas conhecidas como bifurcaá‰es quando um parÉmetro passa por valores cr°ticos denominados pontos de bifurcaá∆o consenso que uma seqÅància de bifurcaá‰es leva ao fenìmeno da turbulància. Esta seqÅància conhecida como seqÅància principal, Ö medida que o parÉmetro progride, geralmente comeáa com coalescància entre uma ou mais bifurcaá‰es de soluá‰es estacion†rias, seguidas por uma bifurcaá∆o, complexa (ou de Hopf, onde ¢rbitas peri¢dicas emergem de soluá‰es estacion†rias), da° aparecimento de um "torus" que pode apresentar dobramentos de per°odos, seguido, finalmente  pelo surgimento de um atrator estranho que caracteriza o fluxo turbulento (caos). As primeiras duas  ou tràs bifurcaá‰es nessa seqÅància s∆o razoavelmente bem compreendidas no sentido matem†tico atÇ explicam certos resultados experimentais, mas Ö partir da bifurcaá∆o "torus" muito pouco compreendido.Para estudar Sistemas Ca¢ticos Ç necess†rio ter conhecimento em tràs estruturas matem†ticas  geralmente usadas em an†lises de sistemas dinÉmicos: o espaáo de fase Ç o espaáo matem†tico vari†veis dinÉmicas de um sistema; a seá∆o de PoincarÇ Ç um "instantÉneo" do movimento e  espaáo de fase, tomados a intervalos de tempo regulares; o espectro de potància utiliza da an†lise  Fourier para demonstrar a composiá∆o das freqÅàncias na variaá∆o temporal das vari†vel dinÉmicas.Para os fins desse trabalho o comportamento ca¢tico foi considerado como a perda periodicidade das vari†veis dinÉmicas no espaáo de fase para sistemas dissipativos. 0 movimento ca¢tico n∆o Ç um fenìmeno raro. Dado um sistema dinÉmico descrito por uma equaá∆o diferencial: para o movimento ser ca¢tico, para alguns valores dos parÉmetros, Ç necess†rio que o sistema tenha  pelo menos tràs vari†veis dinÉmicas independentes e as equaá‰es de movimento contenham b termo n∆o-linear acoplando as vari†veis.Nesse trabalho estamos interessados no comportamento global de um sistema de EDO's segunda ordem, foráado, com amortecimento, no ponto de vista das trajet¢rias (soluá‰es peri¢dicas, atratores estranhos, etc.) no plano de fase do sistema dinÉmico. Portanto, s∆o mostrados resultados  obtidos com um programa, usando um computador PENTIUM 100 MHz rodando o software MATHEMATICA com o comando built-in NDSolve [ ]. Uma equaá∆o diferencial simplificada para o oscilador de duffing foi usada para mostrar o comportamento global em regime perente em funá∆o da amplitude de excitaá∆o

   87:  navegaá∆o
   87:  receptor
   87:  GPS
   83:  Este trabalho consiste em desenvolver uma interface visual num PC, de forma que possa ser utilizada para coletar dados de navegaá∆o de um receptor GPS via porta serial e disponibiliz†-Ias ao usu†rio ou a um sistema inercial. Constitu°do por girosc¢pios e acelerìmetros para melhor precis∆o em navegaá∆o. Tal interface pode, tambÇm, ser utilizada para fins de an†lise do receptor atravÇs do armazenamento dos dados ou simplesmente para visualizaá∆o atravÇs da aquisiá∆o de dados pela porta serial do micro. O Garmin II Ç um receptor vers†til com curtas dimens‰es, adequado para utilidades civis com per°odo de atualizaá∆o de um segundo. Possui uma interface visual no seu console, onde podem ser vistas as coordenadas, a velocidade, dados de navegaá∆o, b£ssola e mapa com a posiá∆o relativa a outros pontos geogr†ficos definidos em sua mem¢ria ( breakpoints ).Tal receptor possui uma interface serial RS232 por onde pode-se fazer a aquisiá∆o de dados. Para realizar tal aquisiá∆o pode-se utilizar alguma biblioteca j† feita ou programar a UART, unidade respons†vel pela comunicaá∆o serial. ê necess†rio configurar a porta serial para trabalhar na mesma freqÅància que o Garmin opera, com o mesmo n£meros de bits de paridade, mesmo n£mero de bits de parada e mesmo n£mero de bits de dados. No caso deste receptor seu protocolo Ç de 9600 bps, sem bit de paridade, um bit de parada e 8 bits de dados. A recepá∆o dos dados pela porta serial pode ser feita utilizando um dos dois mÇtodos: pooling ou interrupá∆o. 0 primeiro consiste em verificar o status da porta serial periodicamente, com o objetivo de que, quando for verificado que houve a chegada de dados, faz-se ent∆o a leitura. A interrupá∆o Ç um recurso oferecido pela estrutura do micro cuja finalidade Ç executar determinada rotina do programa automaticamente quando um byte Ç recebido. A opá∆o de utilizar interrupá‰es Ç com certeza mais eficiente e mais r†pida, no entanto, um pouco mais trabalhosa. Para utilizar o recurso de interrupá‰es Ç necess†rio habilit†-lo na UART e na controladora de interrupá‰es, a 8259. Quando chega um byte no buffer de recepá∆o, imediatamente a 8259 manda um pedido de interrupá∆o ao processador para que a rotina de tratamento feita pelo usu†rio rode. No entanto, para fazer com que o processador rode tal rotina Ç necess†rio mudar os valores do vetor de interrupá∆o da porta serial, colocando o endereáo do in°cio da rotina. 0 receptor da Mitel, o GPS Architect, usa o circuito integrado GP2000 da Mitel Semiconductor em conjunto com o processador P60ARM-B. A programaá∆o interna original deste receptor, cujo c¢digo fonte est† dispon°vel e comentado, pode ser alterada pelo usu†rio atravÇs do ARM Development Toolkit, que faz parte do pacote. Para monitoraá∆o dos dados Ç necess†rio utilizar o WINMON, interface visual tambÇm inclu°da no pacote e designada para ser utilizada num PC. 0 GPS Architect possui tràs portas seriais correspondentes a tràs unidades UART cujas respectivas funá‰es s∆o: monitoramento dos dados; correá∆o diferencial de dados se for requerido alta precis∆o de navegaá∆o; e carregamento e debug interativo de programas. Um programa de monitoramento de dados para plataforma MS-DOS envolve apenas os conceitos b†sicos de linguagem C e conceitos de programaá∆o de porta serial UART e de interrupá‰es. A programaá∆o para Windows em C++, no entanto, Ç mais trabalhosa e envolve conceitos mais recentes sobre classes, objetos e eventos. Todo programa execut†vel para Windows que utiliza objetos possui necessariamente o objeto aplicativo, que Ç aquele respons†vel pela identificaá∆o do programa como um aplicativo  execut†vel . Se tal programa possui uma interface visual padr∆o Windows, ent∆o, deve possuir necessariamente um objeto janela. Uma vez declarado e criado um objeto aplicativo ou janela, o sistema operacional do Windows se preocupar† em enviar eventos a este objeto, quando necess†rio, e s¢ assim linhas do programa ser∆o executadas. Por exemplo, um programador n∆o precisa escrever um programa que desenhe a janela padr∆o Windows, basta que seja criado um objeto janela e, toda vez, que o usu†rio selecionar um item de menu, ser† gerado o respectivo evento, e ent∆o ser† executado a funá∆o que foi escrita para este item de menu. A aquisiá∆o de dados pela porta serial Ç feita utilizando a funá∆o ReadFile atravÇs do handle criado pela funá∆o CreateFile. ê necess†rio utilizar o mÇtodo pooling neste caso pois o Visual C n∆o apresenta um recurso de interrupá∆o dispon°vel para Windows. Utiliza-se ent∆o a funá∆o WaitCommEvent tambÇm j† definida pelo Visual C++ para esperar por eventos relativos a porta serial. Como a programaá∆o para Windows n∆o apresenta uma estrutura cont°nua de execuá∆o Ç necess†rio o uso do rel¢gio atravÇs de funá‰es do pr¢prio Windows para verificaá∆o da chegada de dados. Tanto o receptor da Garmin como o da Mitel possuem um protocolo indicando todos os comandos ( seqÅàncias de bytes ) que est∆o dispon°veis para comunicaá∆o serial. Tais comandos s∆o usados para poder fazer aquisiá∆o dos dados via RS-232. Assim que os bytes s∆o recebidos, estes devem ser convertidos para poderem ser visualizados pelo usu†rio.Como o per°odo de atualizaá∆o de dados Ç relativamente pequeno nos dois receptores, da ordem de um segundo, um sistema com estes aparelhos s¢ seria conveniente implementar em objetos m¢veis que realizassem uma trajet¢ria relativamente est†vel, ou seja, em objetos m¢veis que necessitassem de um per°odo de amostragem superior ou igual Ö ordem de um segundo. Os resultados da comunicaá∆o utilizando a interface desenvolvida podem ser traduzidos por confiabilidade dos dados obtidos, visualizaá∆o f†cil e flexibilidade. 0 £ltimo deles talvez seja o mais importante pois atravÇs da aquisiá∆o peri¢dica de dados de navegaá∆o Ç poss°vel, por exemplo, gerar mapas, fazer catalogamento de terrenos ou mesmo testes de precis∆o do equipamento

   83:  0 objetivo principal deste trabalho Ç fazer um estudo de car†ter geomÇtrico que leva a uma  compreens∆o qualitativa sobre o comportamento das equaá‰es diferenciais n∆o-lineares. Importante salientar que esta informaá∆o qualitativa pode ser conseguida sem necessariamente ter  que resolver, por um mÇtodo anal°tico ou numÇrico, o sistema de equaá‰es diferenciais.Esse estudo comeáa com um sistema de equaá‰es diferenciais mais simples, um sistema  homogàneo, linear, de segunda ordem, com coeficientes constantes, do tipo x = Ax , onde  x =dx /dt, A Ç uma matriz constante 2 x 2 e x Ç um vetor coluna 2 x 1. S∆o denominados pontos  cr°ticos ou de equil°brio os pontos onde x = Ax = 0, e a partir dos autovalores e autovetores deste  sistema se determina o tipo de ponto cr°tico, sua estabilidade e se pode tambÇm obter as trajet¢rias  no plano de fase. Na segunda parte do estudo se  considera  um sistema n∆o-linear, bidimensional, autìnomo x = f (x), e o nosso maior interesse Ç examinar o comportamento das trajet¢rias do sistema n∆o-linear nas  vizinhanáas de um ponto cr°tico x0,para  tal se utiliza do desenvolvimento de Taylor para linearizar este sistema n∆o-linear nas vizinhanáas  do ponto cr°tico. O sistema linearizado Ç dado por x = Ax + g(x) onde g(x) Ç a parte n∆o-linear  do sistema, a partir da linearizaá∆o temos condiá∆o de estudar o tipo e a estabilidade dos pontos cr°ticos podendo tambÇm esboáar as trajet¢rias no plano fase para todo o sistema n∆o-linear

   83:  Para determinar a ¢rbita de um satÇlite artificial usando o sistema GPS, temos que usar as medidas de observaá∆o do GPS. Essas medidas s∆o afetadas por diferentes fontes de erros que causam erros nos observ†veis, tais como erro no rel¢gio do satÇlite GPS e do usu†rio, erros de efemÇrides, desvios de hardware multicaminho, desvios ionosfÇricos e troposfÇricos, ru°dos do receptor e resoluá∆o e dinÉmica do satÇlite GPS, sendo a ionosfera a maior fonte de erros no sinal de propagaá∆o.

   83:  O objetivo desse trabalho Ç estudar a interaá∆o entre o comportamento dinÉmico de uma estrutura r°gida/flex°vel e o sistema de controle, a fim de avaliar a influància desta interaá∆o no desempenho do algoritmo de controle.A montagem da Estaá∆o Espacial Freedon ser† a primeira tarefa de construá∆o complexa a ser realizada no espaáo.Como as estruturas a serem lanáadas s∆o pesadas e grandes seria necess†rio laná†-las separadamente e constru°-las no espaáo.Para isso precisa-se do desenvolvimento da dinÉmica e tÇcnicas para o controle de atitude durante a construá∆o da base espacial.Neste trabalho o problema da flexibilidade do mastro engastado na Shuttle Ç considerado. Como as  manobras da Shuttle move a base do mastro, isto excita o resto da estrutura. O desejado Ç rotacionar o mastro numa posiá∆o adequada e para isso Ç necess†rio um modelamento do sistema dinÉmico e avaliar a interaá∆o deste com o sistema de controle.Alguns mÇtodos de controle s∆o analisados e seus comportamentos investigados para casos particulares atravÇs de an†lise numÇrica. Muitas e muitas aproximaá‰es complexas para controlar estruturas flex°veis tem sido desenvolvida. Neste caso uma dinÉmica estrutural simples Ç adotada e ser† usada para desenvolver um atuador b†sico .Primeiramente as dinÉmicas do mastro s∆o modeladas sem considerar o controle, sendo o interesse maior pela descriá∆o matem†tica do comportamento do mastro, o qual posteriormente ser† usado para estudar o controle do mesmo.Esse mastro Ç modelado considerando a viga em balanáo, onde a base r°gida Ç fixa (engastada) na Shuttle, no qual possui em sua extremidade um atuador (proof-mass) de uma massa m.Uma das primeiras consideraá‰es Ç durante a vibraá∆o livre, no qual as equaá‰es de movimento junto suas condiá‰es de contorno permite determinar implicitamente as funá‰es de forma do sistema, essas equaá‰es s∆o resolvidas numericamente para determinar tambÇm as freqÅàncias naturais desse sistema.Em seguida, s∆o consideradas as rotaá‰es do mastro e as express‰es que s∆o derivadas permitem calcular a energia cinÇtica e potencial em termos da funá∆o de forma. Para resoluá∆o das mesmas s∆o aplicados as equaá‰es de Lagrange para obter as equaá‰es de movimento para rotaá∆o do mastro.Finalmente o uso de atuadores m£ltiplos localizados ao longo do mastro Ç analisado. Estes atuadores podem ser usados para alcanáar raz‰es de amortecimento espec°ficas para primeiros modos de vibraá∆o do sistema.Com o desenvolvimento desse projeto foi poss°vel concluir que para controlar um sistema Ç necess†rio fazer um estudo aprofundado da parte dinÉmica do mesmo. Esse detalhamento foi feito apartir da determinaá∆o das equaá‰es de movimento do mastro, calculando sua freqÅància natural e a sua funá∆o de forma para que pudesse calcular a energia cinÇtica e potencial do sistema e assim modelar essas equaá‰es para ent∆o estudar a parte de controle.Depois de verificado todo o modelamento dinÉmico estudou-se o controle do sistema utilizando atuadoresdo tipo proof-mass. Portanto, atravÇs dos c†lculos obtidos pode-se verificar que esse modelo desenvolvido para a Shuttle e o mastro Ç confi†vel.Acredita-se tambÇm que o projeto do sistema de controle e a avaliaá∆o de sua interaá∆o com a estrutura flex°vel ser† poss°vel nos estudos finais

   83:  A primeira freqÅància natural de painÇis sandu°ches, usada com indicativo de sua rigidez, Ç estudada variando-se tanto o Éngulo das fibras de Carbon de suas faces, quanto a raz∆o entre as dimens‰es de seus lados. O objetivo do estudo Ç encontrar para cada configuraá∆o retangular um conjunto de Éngulos que resulte e rigidez m†xima sem aumento de massa.A metodologia empregada nesse estudo genericamente chamada de Otimizaá∆o Estrutural, adotou basicamente, dois tipos de modelamento: o mÇtodo do elementos finitos e o de Rayleigh-Ritz, usando para o primeiro caso um programa comercial (MSC/NASTRAN) e para o segundo um programa especificamente desenvolvido. No caso do MSC/NASTRAN, a busca do ¢timo Ç fundamentada no mÇtodo das direá‰es vi†veis modificado, e no caso do programa especialmente desenvolvido, no mÇtodo das vari†veis mÇtricas para minimizaá∆o n∆o restrita.Os resultados obtidos numericamente mostram com coerància razo†vel entre os dois tipos de modelamento, um Éngulo ¢timo das fibras crescente e a primeira freqÅància natural decrescente com o aumento da raz∆o de aspecto dos retÉngulo. Por outro lado, enquanto o programa desenvolvido mantinha razo†vel constÉncia de  n£mero de ciclos necess†rio para covergir a um ¢timo, o programa MSC/NASTRA tendia a um n£mero cada vez maior de cicios Ö medida que a raz∆o de aspecto crescia.Nesta linha de investigaá∆o, os pr¢ximos passos ser∆o:1. Mostrar a convergància do MSC/NASTRAN para malhas com variado graus de refinamento, e raz‰es de aspecto limitantes (1 e 3).2. Para os mesmos limites (1 e 3), mostrar a convergància no caso de programa desenvolvido mediante aumento do n£mero de pontos de integraá∆o e de  termos da sÇrie de aproximaá∆o.3. Comparar as soluá‰es ap¢s obtená∆o da convergància

   83:  O  TG tem por objetivo desenvolver um prot¢tipo experimental de um motor de passo h°brido que constitui o principal componente de Mecanismos de Acionamento de PainÇis Solares (MAPS) utilizados em satÇlites artificiais para manter o painel solar apontado para o Sol enquanto o corpo do satÇlite permanece apontado para a Terra. A ànfase do desenvolvimento est† na funcionalidade do dispositivo e na aplicaá∆o voltada para satÇlites de pequeno e mÇdio porte. Mostrando-se vi†vel funcionalmente poderemos partir para a obtená∆o de novos modelos mais eficientes em relaá∆o Ös perdas eletromagnÇticas e otimizados estruturalmente.A partir da dÇcada de 70 a tendància mundial era de projetar e fabricar satÇlites de telecomunicaá‰es de grande porte para ¢rbitas elevadas (geoestacion†rias). Em decorrància, existem hoje dispon°veis no mercado internacional MAPS para satÇlites que requerem potàncias elevadas.Tal desenvolvimento Ç de grande importÉncia estratÇgica no momento em que se mostra interessante para o setor de telecomunicaá‰es a utilizaá∆o de constelaá‰es de satÇlites de pequeno porte, operando em ¢rbita baixa e com consumo t°pico da ordem de 1000 W. Portanto, julga-se bem razo†vel a possibilidade de se colocar brevemente no mercado um produto de alto cunho tecnol¢gico e, praticamente £nico em sua faixa de aplicaá∆o.Um outro ponto importante desse desenvolvimento Ç a possibilidade de outros setores produtivos da economia virem a ser beneficiados pelos resultados gerados pelo projeto. O motor Ç especialmente projetado e constru°do, formando o estado da arte em acionamento elÇtrico, no intu°to de se obter um movimento rotacional suave. Isso melhora, sensivelmente, a precis∆o de posiá∆o do eixo de sa°da e a eficiància do motor, permitindo a utilizaá∆o de motores menores e mais leves. Logo, setores como o da automaá∆o industrial de processos, automaá∆o banc†ria, rob¢tica, mecÉnica fina (motores para plotters, impressoras, etc.) podem ser beneficiados com o repasse da tecnologia gerada no desenvolvimento. Sem contar, tambÇm, que as informaá‰es provenientes de satÇlites tàm se mostrado vital no acompanhamento das mudanáas globais do clima, nas florestas, nas †reas agr°colas, urbanas e na dinÉmica da atmosfera, e, portanto, o projeto, em £ltima an†lise, tem sua contribuiá∆o de cunho ecol¢gico na preservaá∆o do meio ambiente

   83:  Neste programa de Iniciaá∆o Cient°fica, deseja-se propagar ¢rbitas de satÇlites artificiais do sistema GPS (Global Positioning System), com o objetivo de incluir perturbaá‰es orbitais que proporcionam a precis∆o necess†ria Ös modernas aplicaá‰es geodÇsicas atuais.A fim de verificar a correticidade da implantaá∆o do modelo de press∆o de radiaá∆o solar, calculou-se a magnitude das foráas de radiaá∆o solar em funá∆o de um Éngulo Beta, que Ç funá∆o das coordenadas do Sol e do posicionamento dos painÇis solares do satÇlite desejado do Sistema de Posicionamento Global. Verificou-se o comportamento desta perturbaá∆o para este Éngulo de entrada, variando de 0 a 180 graus. De fato conclue-se que, para as aplicaá‰es geodÇsicas, o efeito da press∆o de radiaá∆o solar deve ser inclu°do, e este baseia-se prioritariamente em foráas modeladas, ao longo dos eixos X e Z do corpo do satÇlite. Quanto ao eixo Y, onde existe uma foráa n∆o modelada, atribu°-se valor nulo a princ°pio, pois esta foráa n∆o Ç significativa a ponto de influenciar nos resultados. 0 processo anterior, executado em coordenadas do Sistema Local, posteriormente foi transformado em coordenadas do Sistema Inercial. Para esse fim, precisou-se criar vetores inerciais a partir de coordenadas do Sol e da escolha entre satÇlites do Bloco 1 ou Bloco 2, para a vers∆o T, que incorporam efeitos de reirradiaá∆o tÇrmica para trabalhos de alta precis∆o. Ap¢s o c†lculo da matriz de transformaá∆o inercial, deduzida a partir das coordenadas inerciais, calculou-se as foráas inerciais, correspondentes aos eixos X e Z, compatibilizadas posteriormente pela massa do satÇlite respectivo. E finalmente, ap¢s este £ltimo processo de c†culo, obteve-se as aceleraá‰es, denominadas inerciais.V†rias rotinas e funá‰es, cedidas pela biblioteca Fortran de MecÉnica Celeste, pertencentes ao Departamento de MecÉnica Espacial e Controle (DMC), foram utilizadas. As mais importantes rotinas a serem associada ao programa, Propagaá∆o da ¢rbita de satÇlites artificiais usando receptores GPS, s∆o os integradores RKF78 (tipo Runge-Kutta) ou ADSG12 (tipo multi-passos preditor-corretor), destinados a integrar um sistema de 'n' equaá‰es, a partir da ¢rbita inicial.Os Procedimentos desenvolvidos servem de suporte ao integrador de ¢rbita espec°fico para satÇlites GPS, de tal forma que finalizada sua execuá∆o, obtÇm-se o futuro posicionamento do satÇlite em diferentes tempos desejados, dentro do escopo do projeto de Propagaá∆o de ¢rbitas do Sistema de Posicionamento Global

   83:  Quando um material Ç submetido a v†cuo o fenìmeno da desgaseificaá∆o Ç intensificado. Tal fenìmeno pode ser definido como sendo a liberaá∆o de molÇculas das superf°cies do material e torna-se mais cr°tico a medida em que se aumenta a temperatura. Pode ocorrer tambÇm que uma substÉncia no estado l°quido ou s¢lido atinja a press∆o de vapor na respectiva temperatura e se evapore.Para aplicaá‰es espaciais Ç importante que a taxa de desgaseificaá∆o seja baixa pois as molÇculas liberadas podem se depositar sobre superf°cies de satÇlites artificiais, ve°culos ou experimentos espaciais provocando fenìmenos tais como efeito corona, distorá‰es de imagens de camàras, alteraá‰es de propriedades termo-¢pticas de superf°cies, mudanáas no comportamento de cÇlulas solares entre outros fatores, comprometendo assim o seu funcionamento e a confiabilidade dos dados coletados.Associado ao v†cuo existe tambÇm o problema da falta de convecá∆o de ar gerar mudanáa nos modos de transferància de calor. Isso pode ocasionar gradientes de temperatura relativamente altos ou atÇ mesmo superaquecimento de equipamentos.Variaá‰es tÇrmicas podem levar a variaá‰es dimensionais provocadas por expans∆o e contraá∆o e estas por sua vez gerar trincas ou rupturas.O desenvolvimento da Estaá∆o Multi-Uso para Testes V†cuo TÇrmicos ser† de grande importÉncia no suporte Ö realizaá∆o de testes em materiais que apresentem taxas de desgaseificaá∆o e/ou evaporaá∆o desconhecidas ou altas e tambÇm de materiais cujo comportamento tÇrmico sob v†cuo n∆o Ç perfeitamente definido. Tais testes possibilitar∆o levantar e analisar parÉmetros para qualificaá∆o prÇvia de materiais que poder∆o integrar sistemas espaciais ou para estudos de melhorias nas tÇcnicas de simulaá∆o espacial

   83:  In this paper a generic model for a flexible space system consisting of an arbitrary numbers of flexible bodies connected to form a branched geometry is developed using a Lagrangian formulation. This approach is then applied to derive the equations of motion of the US Space Station first assembly flight configuration , referred as MB-1, taking into account the coupled rigid body/flexible structural dynamic interaction. The matrices of admissible shape functions are used to represent the deformation due to flexibility of the MB-1 model. The equations of motion of the multibody system are written in matrix form, where particular attention is devoted to the development of the kinetic energy expression of rigid /flexible spacecraft model and deriving the inertia properties of the deformable structure that undergoes finite rotations and small elastic deformations. In addition to the inertia matrix and conventional mass matrix that appear, respectively, in rigid body dynamics and the dynamics of linear structural system, it is shown that a set of time-invariant submatrices that depend on the assumed displacement field has to be evaluated in order to completely define the mass matrix of the rigid/flexible spacecraft. These time-invariant matrices appear in the components of the mass matrix and represent the coupling between the rigid and elastic body motion. As a result of the Lagrangian approach the expressions for the system's elastic potential energy due to its flexibility are also derived. The frequency characterization of the MBI model is determined, solving the eigenvalue problem associated with the undamped uncontrollable case, and the potential problem for control structure interactions (CSI) is evaluated. The dynamic equations derived in physical coordinates are transformed into a set of decoupled equations in modal state space form. It is shown that this procedure leads to computational advantages and facilitates to address issues such as model order reduction, truncation, and robustness with respect parameter variation and un modeled dynamics-in the context of the robust control design methodology, such as LTR/LQG, PRLQG and Hoo

   83:  The availability of the environmental data acquired by the increasing number of both the Data Collecting Platform networks DCPs, in the Brazilian territory, and th6 Receiving Ground Stations has been improved for their users. It was reached through the development of a dedicated module in the data processing and dissemination software system SCMCD, which performs both the data reception automatically and the data format analysis more efficiently in the Mission Center. Because the DCP data format can follow different message standards, for instance, the data format standard used by the DCPs in the ARGOS system and that used in the METEOSAT system, it is desirable to enable the Mission Center with intelligence in order to distinguish these different formats. This paper presents the design and implementation of that SCMCD acquisition module which provides the Mission Center with event-driven procedures. In order to perform the recognition and error analysis of several formats of DCP messages and also the Satellite Control Center messages (orbit prediction and the status of the Ground Station receivers), the acquisition module was developed based on a finite state automaton approach. With the automaton approach, the implementation of the SCMCD acquisition module is prepared to incorporate as many different formats of DCP messages as the existing different types of Ground Stations working with environmental data transmission from DCPs. The aggregation of a new for-mat to be processed is easy, since only the actions associated with each event must be coded. The state transmission mechanism is already implemented by the acquisition module. It is only necessary to represent the state/event mapping from the automaton in form of a decision table

   83:  This paper presents the design and implementation of the Antenna Manager Software, defined to acquire the first brazilian satellite from the horizon, track and reacquire it after silent zones. Three strategies are defined to cover the satellite passes. They consist of pointing the antenna, commanding the execution of the TTC station uplink frequency sweep, sending a telecommand to turn on the on-board transmitter, and, accepting commands from operator. This problem was analyzed by the use of a finite state automata and implemented in VAX-FORTRAN language through a decision table. The advantage of this design is the use of a table for handling events, which allows the re-utilization of the software for other missions, only by implementing changes in the decision table. Results on the study of the JSD Method, applied to this software, are also presented. These results show another way to analyze and solve the same problem

   83:   In spatial data analysis application using GIS, users are led themselves to build a mental model of the GIS to be able to explore its capabilities. If the requirements is to meet the user on the high abstract level, the user interface has to be based on a considerable amount of knowledge about the user, the system and the communication process. Additionally, it must be adaptative to come close enough to different categories of users and developed as an user centred system. Knowledge, about the users and the application are fundamental for making GIS interface intelligent. Intelligent AGENT as an agent in the interface instead of agent as an interface is the approach adopted in d paper to diminish the complexity level of the GIS user interface, creating an adaptive interface based on a model of the user and the task. It implements a complimentary style of interaction which has been referred to as indirect management. Instead of unidirectional interaction via commands and/ direct manipulation, the user is engaged in a cooperative process in which human and computer agent(s) initiate communication, monitor events and perform tasks. On a GIS environment, an AGENT as a personal assistent (metaphor used) cooperates with the user in the selection of the GIS functions in a specific application (such as deforestation monitoring). The AGENT learns how assist the user and starts with very little background knowledge of the application. The main knowledge applied is that "typical needs of a specific application field of GIS are limited on specif functions of geoprocessing"

   83:  The first Brazilian Satellite, one out of the family of three Data Collection Satellites -SCD, has been successfully operating as an automatic collector of environmental data acquired by a set of a Data Collection Platforms (PCD) distributed in the Brazilian territory. The data have been used by the scientific community for several applications and studies such as Tropical forest regeneration, ozone layer, greenhouse effect, drifting buoys and so on. Ms paper addresses the software system developed for the Data Collection Mission Center, on tasks of storing, processing and distributing environmental data transmitted by SCD1. The analysis and development of this software were oriented to fulfil the needs of both the Mission Center operators and the users of the environmental data. Techniques for designing user interface centered on user needs were applied

To these protocols it isn't enough the conformance and interoperability testing, it is needed to run the mechanisms that tolerate the faults. This paper presents a tool for protocol testing aimed to show the applicability of the ferryclip concept for fault tolerance testing. This tool, named System for Testing Execution Support - SSE, implements the ferry-clip architecture, which has been augmented with the fault injection technique. The resultant architecture, proposed here, combines the ferry-clip approach for conformance testing with fault-injection for fault-tolerance validation. The SSE is a flexible and portable system for supporting several types of test. Some solutions in implementing it are also presented

   83:  The study of the space plasma environment is the goal of the experiments named: PLASMEX, ORCAS, MAGNEX a PHOTO. They constitute the payload of the first small Brazilian satellite for Scientific Applications ( SACI-1). The SACI-1 is a low earth polar orbit satellite which shall be launched as China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite ( CBER) piggyback, by the Chinese launcher Long March IV, in the beginning of 1998. All the space plasma data measured by the SACI-1 payload will be received and archived in the SACI-I Ground Station by a software system which uses the relational data modeling to build the system data base. Focusing on the space plasma data base, this article describes the Ground Station Software facilities such as: quick-looks the SACI-1 remote sensing data and the data access in raw form from the investigators, via INTERNET

   83:  SACI-SOL software is the heart of Scientific Micro-satellite (SACI) Ground Station. It consists of the Telemetry and Telecommand (TM/TC) software developed to automate satellite control as much as possible, enabling SACI micro-satellite operations to be carried out by a minimum staff. In order to meet the low project cost requirements reducing development time and increasing productivity, Lab VIEW graphical environment was adopted. Focusing on that software development graphical language, this article presents an overview of both the SACI-SOL design solution adopted by the software development team and the way of implementing, in Lab VIEW, classical solutions such as finite state automata, event control, queue mechanisms, among others. Also, an analysis of YM soft ware is done in order to evaluate its performance in receiving, recording, processing and displaying 60 packets/s (1 Kbyte per packet)

Those requirements are unattended control of a satellite passing, quick-look of payload data in real time, playback of all telemetry data, automatic orbit determination and remote mission planning by the investigators through the Internet. Since cost effectiveness has oriented all design solutions in SACI-1 Ground Segment, a compact satellite control system was designed to aggregate in a same environment the functionality of Ground Station, Control Center and Mission Center. That compact SACI-1 Ground System is a platform based on five Personal Computers interconnected through Ethernet local network. Two of them are dedicated to perform TM and TC functions including the Ground-satellite protocol. Another is dedicated to the antenna control for satellite tracking. The last two deals with data dissemination activities such as quick look of both data data of the mission
